== Context and Scope

=== Business Context
The “Fork & Knife” platform acts as a black‐box service coordinating three primary user groups and external systems. The following table summarizes domain‐specific inputs and outputs.

| Communication Partner | Inputs                                                   | Outputs                                              
| Customer App         | • Restaurant search/filter criteria
• Order placement request
• Payment details                                       | • Order confirmation
• Real‐time order status & driver location
• Ratings and reviews                                     
| Restaurant Portal    | • Menu create/update commands
• Order acceptance/rejection
• Preparation time updates                             | • New order notifications
• Status update acknowledgments
• Financial reports

• Job acceptance/decline
• GPS location updates                                  | • Available job offers
• Optimized pickup/delivery routes

=== Technical Context
This section outlines the technical interfaces, channels, and protocols between the system and its environment.

The API Gateway provides a unified entry point over HTTPS (REST/gRPC) and WebSockets, handling authentication (OAuth2/JWT), rate limiting, and routing. Each microservice owns its own datastore. Real‐time communication is achieved via an external event broker.

=== Mapping Inputs/Outputs to Channels

|===
| Domain I/O                       | Communication Channel             | Protocol                
| Search/filter criteria           | API Gateway → Customer Service    | HTTPS/REST
| Order placement & status updates | Bidirectional via WebSocket       | WSS (over TLS)
| Menu management commands         | API Gateway → Restaurant Service  | HTTPS/REST
| Driver GPS updates               | API Gateway → Driver Service      | HTTPS/REST (poll/push)
| Event notifications              | Event Broker → Notification Svc   | AMQP/Kafka protocols
| Payment transactions             | API Gateway → Stripe Adapter      | HTTPS/REST
| Geolocation & routing data       | API Gateway → Maps Adapter        | HTTPS/REST
