== Solution Strategy

The following high‐level strategy and key decisions shape the “Fork & Knife” architecture, balancing functional needs and quality goals.

* **Microservices Architecture**: We decompose the system into bounded‐context services (Customer, Restaurant, Order, Driver, Payment, Notification, Reporting) to enable independent development, deployment, and scaling (see ADR-001).
* **API Gateway Pattern**: All external and cross‐service calls route through a centralized API Gateway to handle TLS termination, OAuth2/JWT authentication, rate limiting, and routing (see ADR-002).
* **Event‐Driven Communication**: A message broker (Kafka or RabbitMQ) decouples services and supports real‐time order and driver updates via publish/subscribe (see ADR-003).
* **Containerized Cloud Deployment**: We target Kubernetes (EKS/GKE) for container orchestration, auto‐scaling, and high availability across multiple AZs (see ADR-004).
* **Adapter Patterns for Integrations**: External dependencies (Stripe for payments, Google Maps for geolocation) are encapsulated behind adapters to allow future provider swaps (see ADR-005 and ADR-006).
* **CQRS & Event Sourcing (where needed)**: Read‐optimized views and audit logs are built from event streams to satisfy performance, auditability, and reporting requirements.

These decisions ensure that the system meets the key quality requirements of scalability, reliability, real‐time responsiveness, and maintainability. Detailed rationale and consequences are captured in the corresponding ADRs.
