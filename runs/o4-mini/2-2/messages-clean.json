The platform will consist of a customer-facing web and mobile app for ordering, a restaurant-facing web portal for managing menus and orders, and a logistics system for delivery drivers.\\n\\n## Context\\n\\nThe market for food delivery is growing, but existing platforms often charge high commission fees to restaurants. \\\"Fork & Knife\\\" aims to be a more restaurant-friendly alternative with a transparent fee structure. The system needs to handle a three-sided marketplace: coordinating orders from customers, preparation by restaurants, and pickup/delivery by drivers in real-time.\\n\\n## Key Stakeholders\\n\\n- **Customers**: Users ordering food.\\n- **Restaurant Owners/Managers**: Users managing menus, prices, and incoming orders.\\n- **Delivery Drivers**: Users who accept and complete delivery jobs.\\n- **Platform Administrators**: Internal team managing platform operations, user support, and payments.\\n\\n## User Stories\\n\\n### Customer Stories\\n\\n- As a customer, I want to browse restaurants by cuisine type, location, price range, and rating, so I can find food I like.\\n- As a customer, I want to filter restaurants based on dietary options (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free), so I can meet my dietary needs.\\n- As a customer, I want to view a restaurant's full menu with descriptions and prices, and add items to my cart.\\n- As a customer, I want to pay for my order securely within the app using various methods (credit card, PayPal).\\n- As a customer, I want to track the status of my order in real-time on a map, from \\\"order accepted\\\" to \\\"in the kitchen,\\\" \\\"out for delivery,\\\" and \\\"delivered.\\\"\\n- As a customer, I want to save my favorite restaurants and re-order a previous meal with one click.\\n- As a customer, I want to rate and review the restaurant and the delivery driver after my order is complete.\\n\\n### Restaurant Stories\\n\\n- As a restaurant manager, I want to receive a clear, audible notification for new orders on a dedicated tablet application.\\n- As a restaurant manager, I want to accept or reject new orders and provide an estimated preparation time.\\n- As a restaurant manager, I want to easily create and update my menu, including photos, descriptions, prices, and categories.\\n- As a restaurant manager, I want to temporarily mark specific items or the entire restaurant as \\\"sold out\\\" or \\\"unavailable.\\\"\\n- As a restaurant manager, I want to view my order history and access financial reports on my daily and weekly earnings.\\n- As a restaurant manager, I want to be able to communicate with the customer or driver regarding a specific order (e.g., \\\"we are out of an ingredient\\\").\\n\\n### Driver Stories\\n\\n- As a delivery driver, I want to set my status to \\\"online\\\" to start receiving delivery job offers.\\n- As a delivery driver, I want to see a list of available delivery jobs near me, including pickup/drop-off locations and the estimated fee.\\n- As a delivery driver, I want to accept or decline a job offer within a limited time frame.\\n- As a delivery driver, I want to use an in-app map with optimized routing to navigate to the restaurant and then to the customer.\\n- As a delivery driver, I want to be able to contact the customer or restaurant if I have issues (e.g., can't find the address).\\n- As a delivery driver, I want to see a summary of my completed trips and my total earnings for the day/week.\\n\\n## Quality Attributes\\n\\n- **Scalability**: The system must be able to handle a high volume of concurrent users and orders, especially during peak lunch and dinner times.\\n- **Real-time Capabilities**: Order status updates, driver location tracking, and notifications must happen in near real-time.\\n- **Reliability**: The system must have high uptime. An outage during peak hours would result in significant revenue loss and user frustration. The payment processing must be completely reliable.\\n- **Interoperability**: The system will need to integrate with third-party services for payments (e.g., Stripe) and mapping/geolocation (e.g., Google Maps).\\n- **Maintainability**: The architecture should allow different teams to work on different parts of the system (customer, restaurant, logistics) independently.\\n\\n## Additional Information Important for the Project\\n\\nThe architecture will likely consist of several distinct backend services (e.g., an Order Service, a Restaurant Service, a Driver Management Service, a Payment Service). These services will need to communicate with each other, likely via a mix of synchronous (REST/gRPC) and asynchronous (message queues like RabbitMQ or Kafka) communication.\\nEach service would have its own database to ensure loose coupling.\\nA robust API gateway will be required to manage and secure access to the backend services from the various client applications (web, iOS, Android).\"}",

            "content": "Below is a curated list of the Architecturally Significant Requirements (ASRs) for the \u201cFork & Knife\u201d Delivery Platform. Each ASR includes a brief description, its rationale, and how it drives architectural decisions.\n\n1. Real-Time Order Status & Driver Tracking  \n   \u2022 Category: Functional/Quality  \n   \u2022 Description: The system must push live updates of order status (accepted, in-kitchen, out-for-delivery, delivered) and driver location on a map with end-to-end latency \u2264 2 seconds.  \n   \u2022 Rationale: Core user value for customers and drivers; drives choice of event-driven messaging (e.g., WebSockets, MQTT) and in-memory data stores for location updates.  \n   \u2022 Verification: Simulated load tests showing sub-2s end-to-end update under peak load.\n\n2. Horizontal Scalability Under Peak Load  \n   \u2022 Category: Quality \u2013 Scalability  \n   \u2022 Description: The platform must auto-scale to support at least 10,000 concurrent active users (customers, restaurant staff, and drivers) and 1,000 orders per minute during peak lunch/dinner times.  \n   \u2022 Rationale: Prevents outages and slowdowns; leads to microservices deployed in containers/orchestrated clusters (Kubernetes/EKS), stateless service design, and independent data stores.  \n   \u2022 Verification: Auto-scaling tests that spin up/down based on CPU/RPS, showing linear throughput increases.\n\n3. High Availability & Fault Tolerance  \n   \u2022 Category: Quality \u2013 Reliability  \n   \u2022 Description: Each core service (Order, Restaurant, Driver, Payment) must achieve 99.9% uptime with zero single-point failures and graceful degradation of non-critical functions.  \n   \u2022 Rationale: Critical revenue-generating system; failure of payment or order routing is unacceptable. Drives multi-AZ deployments, health checks, circuit breakers, and retry policies.  \n   \u2022 Verification: Chaos-engineering exercises (e.g., pod kill, AZ failure) with defined SLAs on failover times.\n\n4. Secure & Compliant Payment Processing  \n   \u2022 Category: Quality \u2013 Security/Interoperability  \n   \u2022 Description: All payment transactions must comply with PCI-DSS standards, integrate with Stripe (or equivalent), and ensure end-to-end TLS encryption and tokenization of card data.  \n   \u2022 Rationale: Protect customer financial data and satisfy regulatory requirements; impacts selection of a dedicated Payment Service, API Gateway TLS termination, and strict network segmentation.  \n   \u2022 Verification: Third-party PCI audit report; successful end-to-end transaction tests.\n\n5. Loose Coupling & Independent Deployability  \n   \u2022 Category: Quality \u2013 Maintainability  \n   \u2022 Description: The system must be composed of independently deployable microservices (Order, Restaurant, Driver, Payment, Notification), each owning its database and schema.  \n   \u2022 Rationale: Enables parallel team workflows, faster releases, and simpler fault isolation. Drives service-per-bounded-context and polyglot persistence considerations.  \n   \u2022 Verification: CI/CD pipeline demonstrating independent builds/deploys for each service without cross-service downtime.\n\n6. Mixed Synch./Asynch. Communication  \n   \u2022 Category: Architectural  \n   \u2022 Description: Synchronous REST/gRPC shall be used for request/response operations (e.g., menu management), while asynchronous messaging (Kafka or RabbitMQ) shall handle high-volume, real-time events (e.g., order created, status updates).  \n   \u2022 Rationale: Balances immediate consistency needs with throughput and resilience. Influences design of message brokers, topic partitioning, and consumer groups.  \n   \u2022 Verification: Architecture diagrams and smoke tests exercising both communication modes under realistic load.\n\n7. API Gateway with Authentication, Rate Limiting & Throttling  \n   \u2022 Category: Quality \u2013 Security/Performance  \n   \u2022 Description: A central API Gateway must enforce OAuth2/JWT authentication, per-client rate limits, and request throttling to protect backend services.  \n   \u2022 Rationale: Shields internal services, centralizes cross-cutting concerns, and prevents abusive traffic patterns.  \n   \u2022 Verification: Rate-limit tests and security scans demonstrating proper enforcement.\n\n8. Third-Party Integration with Mapping/Geolocation Services  \n   \u2022 Category: Functional/Quality  \n   \u2022 Description: Integration with Google Maps (or equivalent) for geocoding, map display, and route optimization, with failover to a backup provider.  \n   \u2022 Rationale: Critical for driver routing and customer tracking; requires adapter pattern for provider-agnostic integration.  \n   \u2022 Verification: End-to-end routing tests, and simulated provider outage with seamless switchover.\n\n9. Multi-Tenant Data Isolation for Restaurants  \n   \u2022 Category: Quality \u2013 Security/Integrity  \n   \u2022 Description: Each restaurant\u2019s data (menu, orders, reports) must be logically isolated to prevent cross-tenant access and support future marketplace expansion.  \n   \u2022 Rationale: Protects restaurant confidentiality and revenue; influences database design (e.g., separate schemas or databases per tenant).  \n   \u2022 Verification: Data-access tests ensuring tenant boundary enforcement.\n\n10. Auditability & Reporting  \n    \u2022 Category: Functional/Quality  \n    \u2022 Description: All key user actions (order placement, acceptance/rejection, payment) must be logged and retained for at least 1 year to support dispute resolution and financial reporting.  \n    \u2022 Rationale: Essential for compliance and stakeholder trust; drives decision to use write-optimized event store or append-only log alongside transactional DB.  \n    \u2022 Verification: Spot checks of audit logs, reporting queries showing historical data.\n\n11. Offline Recovery for Restaurant Order Tablet  \n    \u2022 Category: Quality \u2013 Resilience  \n    \u2022 Description: The restaurant tablet application must queue incoming order notifications locally if the network is down and sync when connectivity is restored.  \n    \u2022 Rationale: Ensures no orders are missed due to temporary connectivity issues; impacts client-side storage and sync protocol design.  \n    \u2022 Verification: Simulated network outage tests with queued notifications.\n\n12. Cross-Platform Client Support  \n    \u2022 Category: Functional/Quality  \n    \u2022 Description: Official support for web, iOS, and Android customer apps plus a web portal for restaurants and drivers, all sharing a common backend API layer.  \n    \u2022 Rationale: Maximizes reach and consistency; drives design of versioned, backward-compatible REST/gRPC APIs and SDK layers.  \n    \u2022 Verification: End-to-end UI smoke tests across platforms against the same API.\n\nThese 12 ASRs define the core architectural drivers for \u201cFork & Knife.\u201d They inform the choice of microservice decomposition, infrastructure (Kubernetes, cloud-managed databases), communication middleware, security perimeter, deployment pipeline, and client-server interaction patterns. Overarching them is the need to balance high throughput, near real-time responsiveness, strong reliability, and secure, maintainable design.",

Architectural Style & Patterns  \n   \u2022 Microservices Architecture \u2013 each bounded context (Customer, Restaurant, Order, Driver, Payment, Notification, Reporting) is its own service with independent data store.  \n   \u2022 API Gateway Fa\u00e7ade \u2013 single entry point for all clients; handles authentication (OAuth2/JWT), routing, rate limiting, and TLS termination.  \n   \u2022 Event-Driven Messaging \u2013 a central message broker (e.g., Kafka or RabbitMQ) for real-time events (order created, status updates, driver location) and loose coupling.  \n   \u2022 CQRS & Event Sourcing (where needed) \u2013 read-optimized views (e.g., customer order history, restaurant reports) built from event streams for auditability and performance.\n\n2. Major Components & Responsibilities  \n\n   2.1 API Gateway  \n     \u2022 Terminates TLS; validates JWT/OAuth2 tokens.  \n     \u2022 Routes requests to appropriate microservices via REST/gRPC.  \n     \u2022 Enforces per-client rate limits and request throttling.\n\n   2.2 Identity & Access Service  \n     \u2022 Manages user identities, roles (customer, restaurant, driver, admin), and OAuth2 flows.  \n     \u2022 Issues and validates JWTs for inter-service calls and client authentication.\n\n   2.3 Customer Facade Service  \n     \u2022 Handles customer browsing, filtering, favorites.  \n     \u2022 Orchestrates menu retrieval from Restaurant Service, price calculations, and checkout initiation.\n\n   2.4 Restaurant Management Service  \n     \u2022 CRUD on menu items, availability flags, category management.  \n     \u2022 Order intake interface for restaurant tablets (with offline queueing & sync).  \n     \u2022 Exposes order-status callbacks to kitchen staff.\n\n   2.5 Order Processing Service  \n     \u2022 Core domain logic: order placement, validation, status transitions.  \n     \u2022 Publishes \u201cOrderCreated,\u201d \u201cOrderAccepted,\u201d \u201cInPreparation,\u201d \u201cReadyForPickup,\u201d \u201cOutForDelivery,\u201d \u201cDelivered\u201d events to message broker.  \n     \u2022 Subscribes to Driver Service events to update delivery states.\n\n   2.6 Driver Management Service  \n     \u2022 Manages driver profiles, status (online/offline), location updates.  \n     \u2022 Exposes job-offer API; publishes \u201cDriverLocationUpdate\u201d and \u201cJobAccepted/Declined\u201d events.\n\n   2.7 Payment Service  \n     \u2022 Integrates with Stripe (or similar) via secure, tokenized gateway.  \n     \u2022 Ensures PCI-DSS compliance, handles refunds, payouts to restaurants/drivers.  \n     \u2022 Emits \u201cPaymentInitiated,\u201d \u201cPaymentSuccess,\u201d \u201cPaymentFailure\u201d events.\n\n   2.8 Notification Service  \n     \u2022 Delivers real-time push/sms/email notifications to customers, restaurants, drivers.  \n     \u2022 Subscribes to domain events (order, payment, driver updates) from broker.  \n     \u2022 Uses WebSockets / MQTT for live updates in web/mobile clients.\n\n   2.9 Reporting & Analytics Service  \n     \u2022 Consumes event streams and builds time-windowed aggregates (daily earnings, order volumes).  \n     \u2022 Supports platform administrators and restaurant financial reports.\n\n   2.10 External Integrations  \n     \u2022 Mapping/Geolocation Adapter \u2013 abstracts Google Maps, with failover to a secondary provider via Strategy pattern.  \n     \u2022 Payment Gateway Adapter \u2013 abstracts Stripe API.\n\n3. Data Management  \n   \u2022 Polyglot persistence: each service owns its datastore (e.g., relational DB for transactional services, NoSQL or in-memory store for realtime location caches, event store for audit log).  \n   \u2022 Multi-tenant isolation: Restaurant Service uses either separate schemas or row-level isolation via tenant identifiers.\n\n4. Communication Patterns  \n   \u2022 Synchronous (REST/gRPC) for user-driven flows: menu management, checkout calls, authentication.  \n   \u2022 Asynchronous (message broker) for high-volume, real-time updates: order lifecycle events, driver tracking, notifications.  \n   \u2022 Back-pressure and retry policies implemented via broker acknowledgments, dead-letter queues, and circuit breakers.\n\n5. Infrastructure & Deployment  \n   \u2022 Containerized services (Docker) orchestrated in Kubernetes (EKS/GKE) for auto-scaling and high availability (multi-AZ).  \n   \u2022 Centralized CI/CD pipelines enabling independent build, test, and deploy per service.  \n   \u2022 Service mesh (e.g., Istio) for mTLS, traffic shaping, observability, and fault injection.\n\n6. Non-Functional Support  \n   \u2022 Scalability: stateless service design + auto-scaling policies (HPA based on CPU/RPS).  \n   \u2022 Resilience: health checks, ECS/Pod restarts, chaos-testing (Simian Army).  \n   \u2022 Security: end-to-end TLS, OAuth2/JWT, network segmentation (VPCs, subnets), WAF.  \n   \u2022 Observability: centralized logging (ELK), metrics (Prometheus/Grafana), distributed tracing (Jaeger).  \n   \u2022 Maintainability: clearly defined service contracts (OpenAPI/gRPC IDLs), semantic versioning, consumer-driven contracts for event streams.\n\n7. Real-Time Order & Driver Tracking Flow  \n\n   1. Customer places order \u2192 API Gateway \u2192 Order Service \u2192 publishes \u201cOrderCreated.\u201d  \n   2. Restaurant Service tablet app subscribes and alerts kitchen (offline queue if needed).  \n   3. Restaurant accepts \u2192 Restaurant Service updates status \u2192 publishes \u201cOrderAccepted.\u201d  \n   4. Driver Service matches driver \u2192 driver app shows job \u2192 driver accepts \u2192 publishes \u201cJobAccepted.\u201d  \n   5. Driver app publishes GPS updates to Driver Service \u2192 DriverLocationUpdate events.  \n   6. Notification Service aggregates and pushes status and driver location to customer via WebSocket.\n\nThis high-level architecture meets the ASRs around real-time responsiveness, scalability, high availability, security, and maintainability.
