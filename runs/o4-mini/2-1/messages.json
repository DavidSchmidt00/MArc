The platform will consist of a customer-facing web and mobile app for ordering, a restaurant-facing web portal for managing menus and orders, and a logistics system for delivery drivers.\\n\\n## Context\\n\\nThe market for food delivery is growing, but existing platforms often charge high commission fees to restaurants. \\\"Fork & Knife\\\" aims to be a more restaurant-friendly alternative with a transparent fee structure. The system needs to handle a three-sided marketplace: coordinating orders from customers, preparation by restaurants, and pickup/delivery by drivers in real-time.\\n\\n## Key Stakeholders\\n\\n- **Customers**: Users ordering food.\\n- **Restaurant Owners/Managers**: Users managing menus, prices, and incoming orders.\\n- **Delivery Drivers**: Users who accept and complete delivery jobs.\\n- **Platform Administrators**: Internal team managing platform operations, user support, and payments.\\n\\n## User Stories\\n\\n### Customer Stories\\n\\n- As a customer, I want to browse restaurants by cuisine type, location, price range, and rating, so I can find food I like.\\n- As a customer, I want to filter restaurants based on dietary options (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free), so I can meet my dietary needs.\\n- As a customer, I want to view a restaurant's full menu with descriptions and prices, and add items to my cart.\\n- As a customer, I want to pay for my order securely within the app using various methods (credit card, PayPal).\\n- As a customer, I want to track the status of my order in real-time on a map, from \\\"order accepted\\\" to \\\"in the kitchen,\\\" \\\"out for delivery,\\\" and \\\"delivered.\\\"\\n- As a customer, I want to save my favorite restaurants and re-order a previous meal with one click.\\n- As a customer, I want to rate and review the restaurant and the delivery driver after my order is complete.\\n\\n### Restaurant Stories\\n\\n- As a restaurant manager, I want to receive a clear, audible notification for new orders on a dedicated tablet application.\\n- As a restaurant manager, I want to accept or reject new orders and provide an estimated preparation time.\\n- As a restaurant manager, I want to easily create and update my menu, including photos, descriptions, prices, and categories.\\n- As a restaurant manager, I want to temporarily mark specific items or the entire restaurant as \\\"sold out\\\" or \\\"unavailable.\\\"\\n- As a restaurant manager, I want to view my order history and access financial reports on my daily and weekly earnings.\\n- As a restaurant manager, I want to be able to communicate with the customer or driver regarding a specific order (e.g., \\\"we are out of an ingredient\\\").\\n\\n### Driver Stories\\n\\n- As a delivery driver, I want to set my status to \\\"online\\\" to start receiving delivery job offers.\\n- As a delivery driver, I want to see a list of available delivery jobs near me, including pickup/drop-off locations and the estimated fee.\\n- As a delivery driver, I want to accept or decline a job offer within a limited time frame.\\n- As a delivery driver, I want to use an in-app map with optimized routing to navigate to the restaurant and then to the customer.\\n- As a delivery driver, I want to be able to contact the customer or restaurant if I have issues (e.g., can't find the address).\\n- As a delivery driver, I want to see a summary of my completed trips and my total earnings for the day/week.\\n\\n## Quality Attributes\\n\\n- **Scalability**: The system must be able to handle a high volume of concurrent users and orders, especially during peak lunch and dinner times.\\n- **Real-time Capabilities**: Order status updates, driver location tracking, and notifications must happen in near real-time.\\n- **Reliability**: The system must have high uptime. An outage during peak hours would result in significant revenue loss and user frustration. The payment processing must be completely reliable.\\n- **Interoperability**: The system will need to integrate with third-party services for payments (e.g., Stripe) and mapping/geolocation (e.g., Google Maps).\\n- **Maintainability**: The architecture should allow different teams to work on different parts of the system (customer, restaurant, logistics) independently.\\n\\n## Additional Information Important for the Project\\n\\nThe architecture will likely consist of several distinct backend services (e.g., an Order Service, a Restaurant Service, a Driver Management Service, a Payment Service). These services will need to communicate with each other, likely via a mix of synchronous (REST/gRPC) and asynchronous (message queues like RabbitMQ or Kafka) communication.\\nEach service would have its own database to ensure loose coupling.\\nA robust API gateway will be required to manage and secure access to the backend services from the various client applications (web, iOS, Android).\"}",

            "content": "Below is a set of Architecturally Significant Requirements (ASRs) for the “Fork & Knife” delivery platform. Each ASR captures a driving constraint or quality aspect that will shape the high‐level architecture.\n\n1. ASR-01: Scalability  \n   • Description: The system must support rapid scale-out to handle peak loads (e.g., up to 10,000 concurrent users and 500 orders per minute).  \n   • Rationale: Peak lunch/dinner traffic spikes; failure to scale leads to dropped orders and lost revenue.  \n   • Priority: High\n\n2. ASR-02: Real-Time Interaction  \n   • Description: Order status updates, driver location tracking, and user notifications must propagate with end-to-end latency <2 sec.  \n   • Rationale: Users expect live tracking; delays degrade user experience and trust.  \n   • Priority: High\n\n3. ASR-03: High Availability & Fault Tolerance  \n   • Description: The platform must achieve ≥99.9% uptime, with no single point of failure in core services (Order, Payment, Driver).  \n   • Rationale: Outages during peak hours incur significant financial and reputational loss.  \n   • Priority: High\n\n4. ASR-04: Payment Integrity & Reliability  \n   • Description: All payment transactions must be ACID-like (idempotent, consistent) and integrate reliably with a third-party gateway (e.g., Stripe).  \n   • Rationale: Financial correctness is non-negotiable; double charges or lost transactions are unacceptable.  \n   • Priority: High\n\n5. ASR-05: Interoperability with External Services  \n   • Description: The platform must integrate with third-party mapping/geolocation APIs (e.g., Google Maps) and payment processors via standardized REST/gRPC interfaces.  \n   • Rationale: Enables routing, address validation, and secure payments without reinventing these capabilities.  \n   • Priority: Medium–High\n\n6. ASR-06: Loose Coupling & Independent Deployability  \n   • Description: Core domains (Customer, Restaurant, Order, Driver, Payment) must be implemented as separate microservices, each with its own datastore and CI/CD pipeline.  \n   • Rationale: Supports independent development, testing, and scaling by multiple teams.  \n   • Priority: Medium–High\n\n7. ASR-07: Security & Data Protection  \n   • Description: All client<–>server and inter-service communication must be encrypted (TLS). Authentication/authorization must follow OAuth2/JWT. Sensitive data at rest (e.g., payment details) must be encrypted.  \n   • Rationale: Protects user data and meets compliance standards (e.g., PCI DSS for payments).  \n   • Priority: High\n\n8. ASR-08: Message-Driven Asynchronous Communication  \n   • Description: Time-insensitive workflows (e.g., order fulfillment notifications, reporting) should use a message broker (e.g., Kafka or RabbitMQ) to decouple services and buffer peaks.  \n   • Rationale: Improves resilience under load and avoids cascading failures.  \n   • Priority: Medium\n\n9. ASR-09: API Gateway & Rate Limiting  \n   • Description: All external clients (web, iOS, Android) must go through a unified API Gateway for routing, authentication, throttling, and request aggregation.  \n   • Rationale: Centralizes cross-cutting concerns and protects backend services from abuse.  \n   • Priority: Medium\n\n10. ASR-10: Observability & Monitoring  \n    • Description: End-to-end tracing, centralized logging, and real-time metrics/alerting (e.g., via Prometheus/Grafana) across all services.  \n    • Rationale: Enables rapid detection, diagnosis, and resolution of incidents and performance bottlenecks.  \n    • Priority: Medium\n\n11. ASR-11: Data Consistency Strategy  \n    • Description: Employ strong consistency for critical operations (payments, order acceptance) and eventual consistency for non-critical aggregates (ratings, analytics).  \n    • Rationale: Balances correctness and system responsiveness.  \n    • Priority: Medium\n\n12. ASR-12: Mobile & Web Push Notifications  \n    • Description: Implement a reliable push notification subsystem (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging, APNs) to inform customers, drivers, and restaurants of state changes.  \n    • Rationale: Essential for alerting stakeholders in real time.  \n    • Priority: Medium\n\nThese ASRs will guide the decomposition into services, choice of communication patterns, data storage strategies, resilience mechanisms, and security controls.

            "content": "High‐Level Architecture for “Fork & Knife”  \n========================================  \n\nBelow is an end-to-end, three-tier microservice architecture designed to meet the ASRs (scalability, real-time, high-availability, payment integrity, loose coupling, etc.).  \n\n1. Presentation Layer  \n   • Web Apps (Customer, Restaurant, Admin)  \n     – Single-Page Apps built with React/Vue, communicating over HTTPS/REST or WebSocket.  \n   • Mobile Apps (iOS/Android)  \n     – Native/React Native clients using REST for commands and WebSocket/Push for real-time updates.  \n\n2. Edge Services  \n   • API Gateway  \n     – Routes inbound requests to the appropriate microservices.  \n     – Handles OAuth2/JWT authentication, SSL termination, rate limiting, request validation.  \n   • Auth & Identity Service  \n     – Manages user signup/login, token issuance (OAuth2, JWT), role-based access control.  \n\n3. Core Microservices  \n   Each service is independently deployed (Docker/Kubernetes), has its own datastore, and communicates via REST/gRPC for synchronous calls and Kafka (or RabbitMQ) for asynchronous events.\n\n   3.1 Customer Service  \n     – Manages customer profiles, favorites, order history, reviews.  \n     – Read-optimized cache (e.g., Redis) for hot data (favorites, recent orders).  \n\n   3.2 Restaurant Service  \n     – Manages menus, availability/status, restaurant profiles, financial reports.  \n     – Publishes “MenuUpdated” events when menus change.  \n\n   3.3 Order Service  \n     – Core “order lifecycle” domain: create, accept/reject, status transitions.  \n     – Implements Saga pattern to coordinate distributed transactions (payment, inventory, driver assignment).  \n     – Strong consistency via relational DB (e.g., PostgreSQL) for order state.  \n     – Emits events (“OrderCreated”, “OrderAccepted”, “OrderCompleted”) to the Event Bus.  \n\n   3.4 Driver Service  \n     – Manages driver profiles, online/offline status, job offers, routing.  \n     – Integrates with Mapping Service to calculate ETA.  \n     – Stores geo-location in a geospatial store (e.g., MongoDB with GeoJSON or Redis Geo).  \n\n   3.5 Payment Service  \n     – Handles payment intents, authorizations, captures via Stripe (or similar).  \n     – Ensures idempotency and ACID‐style guarantees for money movements.  \n     – Persists transactions in a secure, encrypted datastore.  \n\n   3.6 Notification Service  \n     – Subscribes to domain events on the Event Bus.  \n     – Routes push notifications (Firebase, APNs) and in-app messages (WebSocket).  \n     – Ensures delivery with retry logic and dead-letter queue.  \n\n   3.7 Mapping & Routing Service (3rd-party integration)  \n     – Wraps Google Maps APIs or OpenStreetMap for geocoding, routing, distance/time estimates.  \n\n4. Data & Event Infrastructure  \n   • Event Bus (Kafka/RabbitMQ)  \n     – Backbone for asynchronous communication, buffering, high throughput.  \n     – Topic examples: orders, menu-changes, driver-location, payments.  \n   • Databases  \n     – PostgreSQL (Order, Payment for strong consistency)  \n     – MongoDB or DynamoDB (Customer, Restaurant for flexible schemas)  \n     – Redis (caching, session store, geo‐lookup)  \n   • Object Storage (S3 or equivalent)  \n     – Stores menu images, receipts, logs.  \n\n5. Cross-Cutting Concerns  \n   • CI/CD Pipelines  \n     – Automated build/test/deploy for each microservice (GitOps on Kubernetes).  \n   • Observability  \n     – Distributed tracing (Zipkin/OpenTelemetry), centralized logging (ELK), metrics & alerts (Prometheus/Grafana).  \n   • Security  \n     – TLS everywhere, OAuth2/JWT, rate limiting, WAF at the gateway, data-at-rest encryption for sensitive fields.  \n   • Resiliency  \n     – Circuit breakers (Hystrix/Resilience4j), retries with exponential backoff, bulkheads per service.  \n\n6. Deployment & Scaling  \n   • Kubernetes cluster across multiple AZs for high-availability.  \n   • Horizontal Pod Autoscaling based on CPU, memory, and custom metrics (e.g., queue length).  \n   • Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) to provision cloud resources.  \n\nPattern & Style Justification  \n-----------------------------  \n- Microservices + API Gateway: decouples domains, allows independent scaling and deployments.  \n- Event-Driven (Kafka) + Saga: ensures near real-time updates, resilience under load, and distributed transaction management without locking.  \n- CQRS (implicitly via read-optimized caches and event streams) for responsive UIs and scalability of read workloads.  \n- Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters) internally per service for testability and replaceable 3rd-party integrations.  \n\nNext Step  \n---------  \nThis high-level architecture meets our core ASRs.

            "content": "Detailed Design: API Gateway  \n============================  \n\nIn this iteration, we zoom into the API Gateway—the single entry point for all external clients (web, mobile, restaurant tablet). The gateway must satisfy key ASRs around security, scalability, availability, real-time capabilities, and cross-cutting concerns like logging and monitoring.\n\n1. Relevant ASRs  \n   • ASR-01 (Scalability)  \n   • ASR-02 (Real-Time Interaction)  \n   • ASR-03 (High Availability & Fault Tolerance)  \n   • ASR-05 (Interoperability with External Services)  \n   • ASR-07 (Security & Data Protection)  \n   • ASR-09 (API Gateway & Rate Limiting)  \n   • ASR-10 (Observability & Monitoring)  \n\n2. Architectural Patterns & Style  \n   • API Gateway Pattern (a dedicated reverse-proxy edge service) for routing, security, and protocol translation.  \n   • Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) extensions: per-client request tailoring.  \n   • Containerized, stateless edge service (e.g., Envoy, Kong, or Ocelot) deployed on Kubernetes.  \n\n3. High-Level View  \n   [Client Apps] → [Load Balancer] → [API Gateway Cluster] → [Microservices…]  \n                           ↳ [Auth Service]  \n                           ↳ [Config/Service Discovery]  \n                           ↳ [Metrics & Logging]  \n\n4. Gateway Components & Responsibilities  \n\n   4.1 Ingress & Load Balancing  \n     • Receives HTTPS/TCP connections (TLS termination).  \n     • Distributes flatly across gateway pods in multiple AZs for HA.  \n     • Health checks to remove unhealthy pods.  \n\n   4.2 Authentication & Authorization Plugin  \n     • Validates OAuth2 access tokens (JWT) against the Auth & Identity Service or JWKS endpoint.  \n     • Enforces role-based access (e.g., only drivers access driver endpoints).  \n     • Rejects unauthorized requests with standard HTTP 401/403.  \n\n   4.3 Rate Limiter  \n     • Implements per-API and per-API-key quotas (e.g., max 100 requests/min).  \n     • Sliding window or token bucket algorithm.  \n     • Returns HTTP 429 on violation.  \n\n   4.4 Routing & Load-Shedding  \n     • Path- and method-based routing to appropriate service logical cluster via service discovery.  \n     • Supports blue/green or canary via header flags (X-Canary, X-Version).  \n     • Circuit breakers on unhealthy or overloaded backends.  \n\n   4.5 Request/Response Transformation  \n     • Header enrichment: inject correlation IDs, user ID claims.  \n     • Payload modification: BFF aggregates multiple underlying calls for mobile hotspots (e.g., order summary + driver ETA).  \n\n   4.6 Protocol Translation & WebSocket Proxy  \n     • HTTP/1.1 ↔ HTTP/2 or gRPC bridging if microservices expose gRPC.  \n     • WebSocket or SSE proxying to support real-time order status streams.  \n\n   4.7 Observability Plugins  \n     • Distributed tracing headers (W3C Trace-Context) propagated downstream.  \n     • Metrics exposed on /metrics (Prometheus format): request rates, latencies, error codes, circuit-breaker states.  \n     • Structured access logs (JSON) forwarded to centralized logging (ELK or Fluentd).  \n\n   4.8 Admin API & Configuration  \n     • RESTful admin interface (secured with mTLS) for dynamic route updates, plugin config changes, feature flags.  \n     • Backed by a GitOps store or Consul/Kubernetes CRDs.  \n\n5. Interfaces  \n\n   5.1 Client → Gateway  \n     • REST: POST/GET/PUT/DELETE over HTTPS  \n     • WebSocket/SSE: /ws/order-status?token=<JWT>  \n\n   5.2 Gateway → Internal Services  \n     • HTTP/2 + gRPC (where supported) or HTTP/1.1 + JSON.  \n     • JWT forwarded in Authorization header.  \n     • X-Correlation-ID and trace headers for observability.  \n\n   5.3 Admin → Gateway  \n     • REST over mTLS or OAuth2-secured JWT.  \n\n6. Deployment & Scaling  \n\n   • Kubernetes Deployment: N replicas of API Gateway pods.  \n   • Horizontal Pod Autoscaler: scale on CPU, memory, and custom metric (e.g., request queue length).  \n   • Multi-AZ cluster with external Load Balancer (cloud provider).  \n   • Gateway pods are stateless—all config/state in external key-value store (Consul or ConfigMap).  \n\n7. Fault Tolerance  \n\n   • Pods in multiple availability zones, LB health checks.  \n   • Circuit breakers (e.g., connect failures or high error rates trigger short-circuit).  \n   • Bulkheads: isolate heavy-traffic routes into separate plugin chains.  \n   • Retry with exponential backoff for idempotent calls.  \n\n8.

Service Discovery Integration  \n   • Specify how the gateway discovers backend service endpoints (e.g., Kubernetes DNS, Consul, Eureka). Ensure failover if a discovery instance goes down.  \n\n4. WAF Placement and Ruleset Management  \n   • Identify whether the Web Application Firewall is embedded in the gateway (e.g., ModSecurity plugin) or deployed as a separate edge service. Define how rule updates are propagated (e.g., via GitOps).  \n\n5. Configuration Change Roll-Out  \n   • Describe versioning and rollout strategy for dynamic route/plugin changes via the Admin API (blue/green or canary updates) to prevent misconfiguration impacting all pods.  \n\n6. Feature Flag & A/B Testing Support  \n   • If future A/B tests or feature toggles are anticipated, consider integrating a feature-flag subsystem (e.g., Unleash, LaunchDarkly) at the gateway level.  \n\nWith these refinements, the gateway will comprehensively meet the identified quality goals and be production-ready.",

            "content": "Revised Detailed Design: API Gateway  \n====================================  \n\nBelow is the updated API Gateway design incorporating the Architecture Review Agent’s feedback.\n\n1. JWT Validation & JWKS Caching  \n   • On startup, the gateway fetches the JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) from the Auth Service’s JWKS endpoint.  \n   • Cached keys are stored in-memory with a TTL (e.g., 1 hour) and refreshed asynchronously before expiry.  \n   • In case of JWKS fetch failure, the gateway continues using the last-known keys and retries in backoff intervals.  \n   • Fallback to token introspection only if key rotation is detected or cache is stale.  \n\n2. Distributed Rate Limiter Backing Store  \n   • Rate-limiter counters are stored in a Redis Cluster (multi-node, master-replica) with key prefixes per client/API.  \n   • Token-bucket sliding-window algorithm implemented via Lua scripts in Redis for atomic increments and window resets.  \n   • Gateway pods connect to the same Redis Cluster for consistent counters; Redis Sentinel ensures failover.  \n\n3. Service Discovery Integration & Failover  \n   • Gateway uses Kubernetes DNS or Consul Catalog for backend service endpoints.  \n     – In Kubernetes: resolves service.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local via kube-DNS.  \n     – In Consul: queries the local Consul agent’s HTTP API.  \n   • A built-in health checker periodically probes registered endpoints; unhealthy endpoints are evicted.  \n   • Failover: if discovery API fails, gateway retains the last-known healthy endpoint list for a configurable grace period.  \n   • Supports multiple discovery sources via configuration with priority order.  \n\n4. Web Application Firewall (WAF) Placement & Rule Management  \n   • WAF deployed as an in-gateway plugin (e.g., ModSecurity) at the ingress phase.  \n   • Core rule sets (OWASP CRS) version-controlled in Git repository (GitOps).  \n   • Rule updates applied via the Admin API in a staged rollout:  \n     – Push new rule set to Git; CI validates syntax.  \n     – Gateway pods pull updated rules via ConfigMap or Consul KV.  \n     – Apply in shadow mode for 1 hour (logs only), then enforce mode.  \n   • Dedicated WAF logs forwarded to a separate security index in ELK.  \n\n5. Dynamic Configuration Rollout Strategy  \n   • All route definitions, plugin configurations, and feature-flag hooks stored in Git (GitOps).  \n   • Admin API triggers canary or blue/green rollouts:  \n     – Canary: update a subset of pods (e.g., 10%) by label selector; monitor errors/latency for 10 minutes; then full rollout.  \n     – Blue/Green: deploy new version alongside current, switch traffic via Load Balancer weight shift.  \n   • Rollback automated on health-check or SLO breach.  \n\n6. Feature Flag Integration  \n   • Gateway integrates with a feature-flag service (e.g., LaunchDarkly or Unleash).  \n   • Flags evaluated per request using the client’s JWT claims and custom attributes (geography, user tier).  \n   • SDK loaded as a plugin; local in-memory cache receives updates via streaming or polling.  \n   • Enables A/B testing, gradual feature exposure, and emergency killswitch at the gateway level.  \n\n7. Other Core Components (unchanged)  \n   • Ingress & Load Balancer: TLS termination, multi-AZ deployment, health checks.  \n   • Routing & Load-Shedding: path/method-based routing, circuit breakers, retries.  \n   • Request/Response Transformation: header enrichment, BFF compositions.  \n   • Protocol Translation & WebSocket Proxy: HTTP/gRPC bridging, SSE/WebSocket support.  \n   • Observability: Prometheus metrics, OpenTelemetry traces, JSON access logs.  \n   • Security: TLS1.2+, OAuth2/JWT enforcement, IP whitelists, rate limits.  \n\n8. Deployment & Scaling  \n   • Kubernetes Deployment with N replicas across AZs.  \n   • Horizontal Pod Autoscaler on CPU, memory, and custom metrics (e.g., Redis latency, request queue).  \n   • External Load Balancer distributes traffic; GitOps pipelines manage config changes.  \n\n9. How This Addresses the Review Feedback  \n   • Caching JWKS cuts validation latency and avoids runtime outages if Auth Service is unreachable.  \n   • Redis Cluster ensures consistent, distributed rate-limiter state with failover.  \n   • Dual-mode service discovery plus health-check-based failover prevents routing blackholes.  \n   • In-gateway WAF plugin with GitOps rule management ensures rapid, safe security updates.  \n   • Canary/blue-green config rollouts guard against misconfiguration affecting all pods.  \n   • Feature-flag support at the gateway enables traffic-level experiments and rapid disablement.  \n\nThis completes the revisions. The design is ready for another review or implementation.",

Only a few minor refinements are suggested before moving to implementation:\n\n1. JWKS Refresh Metrics  \n   • Add monitoring/alerts for JWKS fetch failures and average refresh latency to detect issues before token validation errors occur.\n\n2. Redis Rate-Limiter Fail-Fast Behavior  \n   • Define a “fail-closed” vs. “fail-open” policy for rate-limiter Redis outages. For example, default to conservative “fail-closed” to protect backends, but allow emergency override.\n\n3. Discovery Grace-Period Configuration  \n   • Ensure the last-known-good endpoint cache TTL and retry intervals for service discovery are configurable per environment (e.g., shorter in dev, longer in prod).\n\n4. WAF Rule Testing Automation  \n   • Incorporate automated security tests (e.g., simulating OWASP top-10 attacks) in CI to validate new rule sets in shadow mode before enforcement.\n\n5. Canary Rollout Health Criteria  \n   • Define precise success/failure thresholds (error rate, latency) for canary promotion and automated rollback to standardize operations.\n\n6. Feature-Flag Fallback  \n   • Specify default behavior if the feature-flag service is unavailable (e.g., use last known flag state, default to off) to avoid runtime errors.\n\nWith these small clarifications in monitoring, operational policy, and automation, the design is ready for production­-grade implementation.",

            "content": "Final Revised Design: API Gateway  \n=================================  \n\nBelow is the API Gateway design updated with the Architecture Review Agent’s final feedback.\n\n1. JWKS Refresh Monitoring  \n   • Metrics:  \n     – jwks_refresh_success_count, jwks_refresh_failure_count  \n     – jwks_refresh_latency_ms (histogram: p50, p95, p99)  \n   • Alerts:  \n     – Alert if failure_count > 0 for 5m  \n     – Alert if 95th-percentile latency > 500 ms over 5m  \n\n2. Rate-Limiter Redis Outage Policy  \n   • Fail-Closed (default): if Redis is unreachable or commands error, all new requests receive HTTP 429 to protect backend capacity.  \n   • Emergency Override: an Admin API flag (“rateLimiterFailOpen”) can switch to Fail-Open mode, allowing all traffic through for emergency operations.  \n   • Monitoring: redis_connection_errors_total and rate_limiter_fail_closed_count metrics raise alerts on sustained failures.  \n\n3. Environment-Configurable Discovery Grace-Period  \n   • Configurable parameters via ConfigMap or Consul KV per environment:  \n     – discovery_grace_ttl (default: prod=120 s, staging=60 s, dev=30 s)  \n     – discovery_retry_interval (default: prod=10 s, staging=5 s, dev=2 s)  \n   • Behavior: if service discovery endpoint fails, gateway uses cached endpoints until grace_ttl expires, then retries according to retry_interval.  \n\n4. Automated WAF Rule Validation in CI  \n   • CI Pipeline Stage “WAF-Validation”:  \n     – Deploy rules in shadow mode to a test gateway instance.  \n     – Execute automated security tests simulating OWASP Top-10 attack vectors.  \n     – Validate that malicious requests are detected/logged.  \n     – Only on successful test results are rules merged and promoted to production shadow mode.  \n\n5. Canary Rollout Health Criteria  \n   • Defined thresholds (configurable):  \n     – Error Rate: <1% 5xx responses on canary pods over 5m  \n     – Latency: p95 latency increase <10% compared to baseline over 5m  \n   • Automated Logic:  \n     – If thresholds met, proceed from 10% canary to full rollout.  \n     – If thresholds breached, auto-rollback to prior configuration and send alert.  \n\n6. Feature-Flag Service Fallback  \n   • Fallback Strategy:  \n     – On startup, gateway loads last-known flag state from local persistent cache.  \n     – If the flag service is unreachable at runtime, continue using cached states.  \n     – Default behavior for unknown flags or cache miss: OFF (feature disabled).  \n   • Metrics & Alerts:  \n     – feature_flag_fetch_failures_total  \n     – Alert if fetch failures persist >10m  \n\nOther Core Components (unchanged)  \n---------------------------------  \n• Ingress & Load Balancer, Routing, Circuit Breakers, Protocol Translation, Observability, Security plugins, Deployment & Scaling remain as previously specified.\n\nThis completes all requested enhancements. The API Gateway design now includes comprehensive monitoring, operational policies, configurability, CI security validation, and robust feature-flag resiliency.",
