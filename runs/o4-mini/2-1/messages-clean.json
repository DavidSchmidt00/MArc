The platform will consist of a customer-facing web and mobile app for ordering, a restaurant-facing web portal for managing menus and orders, and a logistics system for delivery drivers.\\n\\n## Context\\n\\nThe market for food delivery is growing, but existing platforms often charge high commission fees to restaurants. \\\"Fork & Knife\\\" aims to be a more restaurant-friendly alternative with a transparent fee structure. The system needs to handle a three-sided marketplace: coordinating orders from customers, preparation by restaurants, and pickup/delivery by drivers in real-time.\\n\\n## Key Stakeholders\\n\\n- **Customers**: Users ordering food.\\n- **Restaurant Owners/Managers**: Users managing menus, prices, and incoming orders.\\n- **Delivery Drivers**: Users who accept and complete delivery jobs.\\n- **Platform Administrators**: Internal team managing platform operations, user support, and payments.\\n\\n## User Stories\\n\\n### Customer Stories\\n\\n- As a customer, I want to browse restaurants by cuisine type, location, price range, and rating, so I can find food I like.\\n- As a customer, I want to filter restaurants based on dietary options (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free), so I can meet my dietary needs.\\n- As a customer, I want to view a restaurant's full menu with descriptions and prices, and add items to my cart.\\n- As a customer, I want to pay for my order securely within the app using various methods (credit card, PayPal).\\n- As a customer, I want to track the status of my order in real-time on a map, from \\\"order accepted\\\" to \\\"in the kitchen,\\\" \\\"out for delivery,\\\" and \\\"delivered.\\\"\\n- As a customer, I want to save my favorite restaurants and re-order a previous meal with one click.\\n- As a customer, I want to rate and review the restaurant and the delivery driver after my order is complete.\\n\\n### Restaurant Stories\\n\\n- As a restaurant manager, I want to receive a clear, audible notification for new orders on a dedicated tablet application.\\n- As a restaurant manager, I want to accept or reject new orders and provide an estimated preparation time.\\n- As a restaurant manager, I want to easily create and update my menu, including photos, descriptions, prices, and categories.\\n- As a restaurant manager, I want to temporarily mark specific items or the entire restaurant as \\\"sold out\\\" or \\\"unavailable.\\\"\\n- As a restaurant manager, I want to view my order history and access financial reports on my daily and weekly earnings.\\n- As a restaurant manager, I want to be able to communicate with the customer or driver regarding a specific order (e.g., \\\"we are out of an ingredient\\\").\\n\\n### Driver Stories\\n\\n- As a delivery driver, I want to set my status to \\\"online\\\" to start receiving delivery job offers.\\n- As a delivery driver, I want to see a list of available delivery jobs near me, including pickup/drop-off locations and the estimated fee.\\n- As a delivery driver, I want to accept or decline a job offer within a limited time frame.\\n- As a delivery driver, I want to use an in-app map with optimized routing to navigate to the restaurant and then to the customer.\\n- As a delivery driver, I want to be able to contact the customer or restaurant if I have issues (e.g., can't find the address).\\n- As a delivery driver, I want to see a summary of my completed trips and my total earnings for the day/week.\\n\\n## Quality Attributes\\n\\n- **Scalability**: The system must be able to handle a high volume of concurrent users and orders, especially during peak lunch and dinner times.\\n- **Real-time Capabilities**: Order status updates, driver location tracking, and notifications must happen in near real-time.\\n- **Reliability**: The system must have high uptime. An outage during peak hours would result in significant revenue loss and user frustration. The payment processing must be completely reliable.\\n- **Interoperability**: The system will need to integrate with third-party services for payments (e.g., Stripe) and mapping/geolocation (e.g., Google Maps).\\n- **Maintainability**: The architecture should allow different teams to work on different parts of the system (customer, restaurant, logistics) independently.\\n\\n## Additional Information Important for the Project\\n\\nThe architecture will likely consist of several distinct backend services (e.g., an Order Service, a Restaurant Service, a Driver Management Service, a Payment Service). These services will need to communicate with each other, likely via a mix of synchronous (REST/gRPC) and asynchronous (message queues like RabbitMQ or Kafka) communication.\\nEach service would have its own database to ensure loose coupling.\\nA robust API gateway will be required to manage and secure access to the backend services from the various client applications (web, iOS, Android).\"}",

            "content": "Below is a set of Architecturally Significant Requirements (ASRs) for the \u201cFork & Knife\u201d delivery platform. Each ASR captures a driving constraint or quality aspect that will shape the high\u2010level architecture.\n\n1. ASR-01: Scalability  \n   \u2022 Description: The system must support rapid scale-out to handle peak loads (e.g., up to 10,000 concurrent users and 500 orders per minute).  \n   \u2022 Rationale: Peak lunch/dinner traffic spikes; failure to scale leads to dropped orders and lost revenue.  \n   \u2022 Priority: High\n\n2. ASR-02: Real-Time Interaction  \n   \u2022 Description: Order status updates, driver location tracking, and user notifications must propagate with end-to-end latency <2\u2009sec.  \n   \u2022 Rationale: Users expect live tracking; delays degrade user experience and trust.  \n   \u2022 Priority: High\n\n3. ASR-03: High Availability & Fault Tolerance  \n   \u2022 Description: The platform must achieve \u226599.9% uptime, with no single point of failure in core services (Order, Payment, Driver).  \n   \u2022 Rationale: Outages during peak hours incur significant financial and reputational loss.  \n   \u2022 Priority: High\n\n4. ASR-04: Payment Integrity & Reliability  \n   \u2022 Description: All payment transactions must be ACID-like (idempotent, consistent) and integrate reliably with a third-party gateway (e.g., Stripe).  \n   \u2022 Rationale: Financial correctness is non-negotiable; double charges or lost transactions are unacceptable.  \n   \u2022 Priority: High\n\n5. ASR-05: Interoperability with External Services  \n   \u2022 Description: The platform must integrate with third-party mapping/geolocation APIs (e.g., Google Maps) and payment processors via standardized REST/gRPC interfaces.  \n   \u2022 Rationale: Enables routing, address validation, and secure payments without reinventing these capabilities.  \n   \u2022 Priority: Medium\u2013High\n\n6. ASR-06: Loose Coupling & Independent Deployability  \n   \u2022 Description: Core domains (Customer, Restaurant, Order, Driver, Payment) must be implemented as separate microservices, each with its own datastore and CI/CD pipeline.  \n   \u2022 Rationale: Supports independent development, testing, and scaling by multiple teams.  \n   \u2022 Priority: Medium\u2013High\n\n7. ASR-07: Security & Data Protection  \n   \u2022 Description: All client<\u2013>server and inter-service communication must be encrypted (TLS). Authentication/authorization must follow OAuth2/JWT. Sensitive data at rest (e.g., payment details) must be encrypted.  \n   \u2022 Rationale: Protects user data and meets compliance standards (e.g., PCI DSS for payments).  \n   \u2022 Priority: High\n\n8. ASR-08: Message-Driven Asynchronous Communication  \n   \u2022 Description: Time-insensitive workflows (e.g., order fulfillment notifications, reporting) should use a message broker (e.g., Kafka or RabbitMQ) to decouple services and buffer peaks.  \n   \u2022 Rationale: Improves resilience under load and avoids cascading failures.  \n   \u2022 Priority: Medium\n\n9. ASR-09: API Gateway & Rate Limiting  \n   \u2022 Description: All external clients (web, iOS, Android) must go through a unified API Gateway for routing, authentication, throttling, and request aggregation.  \n   \u2022 Rationale: Centralizes cross-cutting concerns and protects backend services from abuse.  \n   \u2022 Priority: Medium\n\n10. ASR-10: Observability & Monitoring  \n    \u2022 Description: End-to-end tracing, centralized logging, and real-time metrics/alerting (e.g., via Prometheus/Grafana) across all services.  \n    \u2022 Rationale: Enables rapid detection, diagnosis, and resolution of incidents and performance bottlenecks.  \n    \u2022 Priority: Medium\n\n11. ASR-11: Data Consistency Strategy  \n    \u2022 Description: Employ strong consistency for critical operations (payments, order acceptance) and eventual consistency for non-critical aggregates (ratings, analytics).  \n    \u2022 Rationale: Balances correctness and system responsiveness.  \n    \u2022 Priority: Medium\n\n12. ASR-12: Mobile & Web Push Notifications  \n    \u2022 Description: Implement a reliable push notification subsystem (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging, APNs) to inform customers, drivers, and restaurants of state changes.  \n    \u2022 Rationale: Essential for alerting stakeholders in real time.  \n    \u2022 Priority: Medium\n\nThese ASRs will guide the decomposition into services, choice of communication patterns, data storage strategies, resilience mechanisms, and security controls.

            "content": "High\u2010Level Architecture for \u201cFork & Knife\u201d  \n========================================  \n\nBelow is an end-to-end, three-tier microservice architecture designed to meet the ASRs (scalability, real-time, high-availability, payment integrity, loose coupling, etc.).  \n\n1. Presentation Layer  \n   \u2022 Web Apps (Customer, Restaurant, Admin)  \n     \u2013 Single-Page Apps built with React/Vue, communicating over HTTPS/REST or WebSocket.  \n   \u2022 Mobile Apps (iOS/Android)  \n     \u2013 Native/React Native clients using REST for commands and WebSocket/Push for real-time updates.  \n\n2. Edge Services  \n   \u2022 API Gateway  \n     \u2013 Routes inbound requests to the appropriate microservices.  \n     \u2013 Handles OAuth2/JWT authentication, SSL termination, rate limiting, request validation.  \n   \u2022 Auth & Identity Service  \n     \u2013 Manages user signup/login, token issuance (OAuth2, JWT), role-based access control.  \n\n3. Core Microservices  \n   Each service is independently deployed (Docker/Kubernetes), has its own datastore, and communicates via REST/gRPC for synchronous calls and Kafka (or RabbitMQ) for asynchronous events.\n\n   3.1 Customer Service  \n     \u2013 Manages customer profiles, favorites, order history, reviews.  \n     \u2013 Read-optimized cache (e.g., Redis) for hot data (favorites, recent orders).  \n\n   3.2 Restaurant Service  \n     \u2013 Manages menus, availability/status, restaurant profiles, financial reports.  \n     \u2013 Publishes \u201cMenuUpdated\u201d events when menus change.  \n\n   3.3 Order Service  \n     \u2013 Core \u201corder lifecycle\u201d domain: create, accept/reject, status transitions.  \n     \u2013 Implements Saga pattern to coordinate distributed transactions (payment, inventory, driver assignment).  \n     \u2013 Strong consistency via relational DB (e.g., PostgreSQL) for order state.  \n     \u2013 Emits events (\u201cOrderCreated\u201d, \u201cOrderAccepted\u201d, \u201cOrderCompleted\u201d) to the Event Bus.  \n\n   3.4 Driver Service  \n     \u2013 Manages driver profiles, online/offline status, job offers, routing.  \n     \u2013 Integrates with Mapping Service to calculate ETA.  \n     \u2013 Stores geo-location in a geospatial store (e.g., MongoDB with GeoJSON or Redis Geo).  \n\n   3.5 Payment Service  \n     \u2013 Handles payment intents, authorizations, captures via Stripe (or similar).  \n     \u2013 Ensures idempotency and ACID\u2010style guarantees for money movements.  \n     \u2013 Persists transactions in a secure, encrypted datastore.  \n\n   3.6 Notification Service  \n     \u2013 Subscribes to domain events on the Event Bus.  \n     \u2013 Routes push notifications (Firebase, APNs) and in-app messages (WebSocket).  \n     \u2013 Ensures delivery with retry logic and dead-letter queue.  \n\n   3.7 Mapping & Routing Service (3rd-party integration)  \n     \u2013 Wraps Google Maps APIs or OpenStreetMap for geocoding, routing, distance/time estimates.  \n\n4. Data & Event Infrastructure  \n   \u2022 Event Bus (Kafka/RabbitMQ)  \n     \u2013 Backbone for asynchronous communication, buffering, high throughput.  \n     \u2013 Topic examples: orders, menu-changes, driver-location, payments.  \n   \u2022 Databases  \n     \u2013 PostgreSQL (Order, Payment for strong consistency)  \n     \u2013 MongoDB or DynamoDB (Customer, Restaurant for flexible schemas)  \n     \u2013 Redis (caching, session store, geo\u2010lookup)  \n   \u2022 Object Storage (S3 or equivalent)  \n     \u2013 Stores menu images, receipts, logs.  \n\n5. Cross-Cutting Concerns  \n   \u2022 CI/CD Pipelines  \n     \u2013 Automated build/test/deploy for each microservice (GitOps on Kubernetes).  \n   \u2022 Observability  \n     \u2013 Distributed tracing (Zipkin/OpenTelemetry), centralized logging (ELK), metrics & alerts (Prometheus/Grafana).  \n   \u2022 Security  \n     \u2013 TLS everywhere, OAuth2/JWT, rate limiting, WAF at the gateway, data-at-rest encryption for sensitive fields.  \n   \u2022 Resiliency  \n     \u2013 Circuit breakers (Hystrix/Resilience4j), retries with exponential backoff, bulkheads per service.  \n\n6. Deployment & Scaling  \n   \u2022 Kubernetes cluster across multiple AZs for high-availability.  \n   \u2022 Horizontal Pod Autoscaling based on CPU, memory, and custom metrics (e.g., queue length).  \n   \u2022 Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) to provision cloud resources.  \n\nPattern & Style Justification  \n-----------------------------  \n- Microservices + API Gateway: decouples domains, allows independent scaling and deployments.  \n- Event-Driven (Kafka) + Saga: ensures near real-time updates, resilience under load, and distributed transaction management without locking.  \n- CQRS (implicitly via read-optimized caches and event streams) for responsive UIs and scalability of read workloads.  \n- Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters) internally per service for testability and replaceable 3rd-party integrations.  \n\nNext Step  \n---------  \nThis high-level architecture meets our core ASRs.

Fault Tolerance  \n\n   \u2022 Pods in multiple availability zones, LB health checks.  \n   \u2022 Circuit breakers (e.g., connect failures or high error rates trigger short-circuit).  \n   \u2022 Bulkheads: isolate heavy-traffic routes into separate plugin chains.  \n   \u2022 Retry with exponential backoff for idempotent calls.  \n\n8. Security  \n\n   \u2022 TLS 1.2+ at ingress.  \n   \u2022 JWT validation, scope checks per route.  \n   \u2022 WAF rules at the edge (SQLi, XSS protection).  \n   \u2022 IP-allow lists for Admin API.  \n   \u2022 Rate limiting as first line of defense.  \n\n9. Observability & Operations  \n\n   \u2022 Metrics: Prometheus scrape endpoint on each pod.  \n   \u2022 Tracing: OpenTelemetry exporter to Jaeger/Zipkin.  \n   \u2022 Logging: JSON logs shipped via Fluentd to ELK.  \n   \u2022 Alerts: error rate spike, latency SLO breaches, pod restart counts.  \n\n10. How This Meets ASRs  \n\n   \u2022 Scalability (ASR-01): stateless pods auto-scale on demand.  \n   \u2022 Real-Time (ASR-02): WebSocket proxy, low-latency routing, BFF composition.  \n   \u2022 High Availability (ASR-03): multi-AZ pods, LB health checks.  \n   \u2022 Interoperability (ASR-05): supports REST, gRPC, WebSocket, plugin-based integrations.  \n   \u2022 Security (ASR-07): TLS, OAuth2/JWT, WAF, rate limiting.  \n   \u2022 Rate Limiting (ASR-09): built-in token bucket per client/API.  \n   \u2022 Observability (ASR-10): metrics, logs, traces, alerting.  \n\nAPI Gateway detailed design is now complete and ready for Architecture Review.",

            "content": "Revised Detailed Design: API Gateway  \n====================================  \n\nBelow is the updated API Gateway design incorporating the Architecture Review Agent\u2019s feedback.\n\n1. JWT Validation & JWKS Caching  \n   \u2022 On startup, the gateway fetches the JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) from the Auth Service\u2019s JWKS endpoint.  \n   \u2022 Cached keys are stored in-memory with a TTL (e.g., 1 hour) and refreshed asynchronously before expiry.  \n   \u2022 In case of JWKS fetch failure, the gateway continues using the last-known keys and retries in backoff intervals.  \n   \u2022 Fallback to token introspection only if key rotation is detected or cache is stale.  \n\n2. Distributed Rate Limiter Backing Store  \n   \u2022 Rate-limiter counters are stored in a Redis Cluster (multi-node, master-replica) with key prefixes per client/API.  \n   \u2022 Token-bucket sliding-window algorithm implemented via Lua scripts in Redis for atomic increments and window resets.  \n   \u2022 Gateway pods connect to the same Redis Cluster for consistent counters; Redis Sentinel ensures failover.  \n\n3. Service Discovery Integration & Failover  \n   \u2022 Gateway uses Kubernetes DNS or Consul Catalog for backend service endpoints.  \n     \u2013 In Kubernetes: resolves service.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local via kube-DNS.  \n     \u2013 In Consul: queries the local Consul agent\u2019s HTTP API.  \n   \u2022 A built-in health checker periodically probes registered endpoints; unhealthy endpoints are evicted.  \n   \u2022 Failover: if discovery API fails, gateway retains the last-known healthy endpoint list for a configurable grace period.  \n   \u2022 Supports multiple discovery sources via configuration with priority order.  \n\n4. Web Application Firewall (WAF) Placement & Rule Management  \n   \u2022 WAF deployed as an in-gateway plugin (e.g., ModSecurity) at the ingress phase.  \n   \u2022 Core rule sets (OWASP CRS) version-controlled in Git repository (GitOps).  \n   \u2022 Rule updates applied via the Admin API in a staged rollout:  \n     \u2013 Push new rule set to Git; CI validates syntax.  \n     \u2013 Gateway pods pull updated rules via ConfigMap or Consul KV.  \n     \u2013 Apply in shadow mode for 1 hour (logs only), then enforce mode.  \n   \u2022 Dedicated WAF logs forwarded to a separate security index in ELK.  \n\n5. Dynamic Configuration Rollout Strategy  \n   \u2022 All route definitions, plugin configurations, and feature-flag hooks stored in Git (GitOps).  \n   \u2022 Admin API triggers canary or blue/green rollouts:  \n     \u2013 Canary: update a subset of pods (e.g., 10%) by label selector; monitor errors/latency for 10 minutes; then full rollout.  \n     \u2013 Blue/Green: deploy new version alongside current, switch traffic via Load Balancer weight shift.  \n   \u2022 Rollback automated on health-check or SLO breach.  \n\n6. Feature Flag Integration  \n   \u2022 Gateway integrates with a feature-flag service (e.g., LaunchDarkly or Unleash).  \n   \u2022 Flags evaluated per request using the client\u2019s JWT claims and custom attributes (geography, user tier).  \n   \u2022 SDK loaded as a plugin; local in-memory cache receives updates via streaming or polling.  \n   \u2022 Enables A/B testing, gradual feature exposure, and emergency killswitch at the gateway level.  \n\n7. Other Core Components (unchanged)  \n   \u2022 Ingress & Load Balancer: TLS termination, multi-AZ deployment, health checks.  \n   \u2022 Routing & Load-Shedding: path/method-based routing, circuit breakers, retries.  \n   \u2022 Request/Response Transformation: header enrichment, BFF compositions.  \n   \u2022 Protocol Translation & WebSocket Proxy: HTTP/gRPC bridging, SSE/WebSocket support.  \n   \u2022 Observability: Prometheus metrics, OpenTelemetry traces, JSON access logs.  \n   \u2022 Security: TLS1.2+, OAuth2/JWT enforcement, IP whitelists, rate limits.  \n\n8. Deployment & Scaling  \n   \u2022 Kubernetes Deployment with N replicas across AZs.  \n   \u2022 Horizontal Pod Autoscaler on CPU, memory, and custom metrics (e.g., Redis latency, request queue).  \n   \u2022 External Load Balancer distributes traffic; GitOps pipelines manage config changes.  \n\n9. How This Addresses the Review Feedback  \n   \u2022 Caching JWKS cuts validation latency and avoids runtime outages if Auth Service is unreachable.  \n   \u2022 Redis Cluster ensures consistent, distributed rate-limiter state with failover.  \n   \u2022 Dual-mode service discovery plus health-check-based failover prevents routing blackholes.  \n   \u2022 In-gateway WAF plugin with GitOps rule management ensures rapid, safe security updates.  \n   \u2022 Canary/blue-green config rollouts guard against misconfiguration affecting all pods.  \n   \u2022 Feature-flag support at the gateway enables traffic-level experiments and rapid disablement.  \n\nThis completes the revisions. The design is ready for another review or implementation.",

Only a few minor refinements are suggested before moving to implementation:\n\n1. JWKS Refresh Metrics  \n   \u2022 Add monitoring/alerts for JWKS fetch failures and average refresh latency to detect issues before token validation errors occur.\n\n2. Redis Rate-Limiter Fail-Fast Behavior  \n   \u2022 Define a \u201cfail-closed\u201d vs. \u201cfail-open\u201d policy for rate-limiter Redis outages. For example, default to conservative \u201cfail-closed\u201d to protect backends, but allow emergency override.\n\n3. Discovery Grace-Period Configuration  \n   \u2022 Ensure the last-known-good endpoint cache TTL and retry intervals for service discovery are configurable per environment (e.g., shorter in dev, longer in prod).\n\n4. WAF Rule Testing Automation  \n   \u2022 Incorporate automated security tests (e.g., simulating OWASP top-10 attacks) in CI to validate new rule sets in shadow mode before enforcement.\n\n5. Canary Rollout Health Criteria  \n   \u2022 Define precise success/failure thresholds (error rate, latency) for canary promotion and automated rollback to standardize operations.\n\n6. Feature-Flag Fallback  \n   \u2022 Specify default behavior if the feature-flag service is unavailable (e.g., use last known flag state, default to off) to avoid runtime errors.\n\nWith these small clarifications in monitoring, operational policy, and automation, the design is ready for production\u00ad-grade implementation.",

JWKS Refresh Monitoring  \n   \u2022 Metrics:  \n     \u2013 jwks_refresh_success_count, jwks_refresh_failure_count  \n     \u2013 jwks_refresh_latency_ms (histogram: p50, p95, p99)  \n   \u2022 Alerts:  \n     \u2013 Alert if failure_count > 0 for 5m  \n     \u2013 Alert if 95th-percentile latency > 500 ms over 5m  \n\n2. Rate-Limiter Redis Outage Policy  \n   \u2022 Fail-Closed (default): if Redis is unreachable or commands error, all new requests receive HTTP 429 to protect backend capacity.  \n   \u2022 Emergency Override: an Admin API flag (\u201crateLimiterFailOpen\u201d) can switch to Fail-Open mode, allowing all traffic through for emergency operations.  \n   \u2022 Monitoring: redis_connection_errors_total and rate_limiter_fail_closed_count metrics raise alerts on sustained failures.  \n\n3. Environment-Configurable Discovery Grace-Period  \n   \u2022 Configurable parameters via ConfigMap or Consul KV per environment:  \n     \u2013 discovery_grace_ttl (default: prod=120 s, staging=60 s, dev=30 s)  \n     \u2013 discovery_retry_interval (default: prod=10 s, staging=5 s, dev=2 s)  \n   \u2022 Behavior: if service discovery endpoint fails, gateway uses cached endpoints until grace_ttl expires, then retries according to retry_interval.  \n\n4. Automated WAF Rule Validation in CI  \n   \u2022 CI Pipeline Stage \u201cWAF-Validation\u201d:  \n     \u2013 Deploy rules in shadow mode to a test gateway instance.  \n     \u2013 Execute automated security tests simulating OWASP Top-10 attack vectors.  \n     \u2013 Validate that malicious requests are detected/logged.  \n     \u2013 Only on successful test results are rules merged and promoted to production shadow mode.  \n\n5. Canary Rollout Health Criteria  \n   \u2022 Defined thresholds (configurable):  \n     \u2013 Error Rate: <1% 5xx responses on canary pods over 5m  \n     \u2013 Latency: p95 latency increase <10% compared to baseline over 5m  \n   \u2022 Automated Logic:  \n     \u2013 If thresholds met, proceed from 10% canary to full rollout.  \n     \u2013 If thresholds breached, auto-rollback to prior configuration and send alert.  \n\n6. Feature-Flag Service Fallback  \n   \u2022 Fallback Strategy:  \n     \u2013 On startup, gateway loads last-known flag state from local persistent cache.  \n     \u2013 If the flag service is unreachable at runtime, continue using cached states.  \n     \u2013 Default behavior for unknown flags or cache miss: OFF (feature disabled).  \n   \u2022 Metrics & Alerts:  \n     \u2013 feature_flag_fetch_failures_total  \n     \u2013 Alert if fetch failures persist >10m  \n\nOther Core Components (unchanged)  \n---------------------------------  \n\u2022 Ingress & Load Balancer, Routing, Circuit Breakers, Protocol Translation, Observability, Security plugins, Deployment & Scaling remain as previously specified.\n\nThis completes all requested enhancements. The API Gateway design now includes comprehensive monitoring, operational policies, configurability, CI security validation, and robust feature-flag resiliency.",
