= ADR-001: Microservices Decomposition

== Context

The system must support independent development, deployment, and scaling of distinct functional areas (Customer, Restaurant, Order, Driver, Payment) by multiple teams. A monolithic architecture would hinder continuous delivery and scaling granularity.

== Decision

We will adopt a microservices architecture. Each core domain will be implemented as an independent service with its own datastore and CI/CD pipeline. Services will communicate synchronously via REST/gRPC for request/response interactions and asynchronously via an event bus for domain events.

== Consequences

* Positive:
** Independent deployability allows teams to release features without cross-team coordination.
** Fine-grained scaling of services reduces resource costs under variable load.
** Clear service boundaries improve maintainability and fault isolation.

* Negative:
** Operational complexity increases (service discovery, distributed tracing, network latency).
** Data consistency challenges across service boundaries.
** Increased need for automation and orchestration.
