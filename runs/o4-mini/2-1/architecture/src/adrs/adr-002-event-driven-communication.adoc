= ADR-002: Event-Driven Communication with Kafka

== Context

The platform requires near real-time updates (order status, driver location) and decoupling between services to handle peak loads. Synchronous communication under high load can lead to bottlenecks and cascading failures.

== Decision

We will use an event-driven architecture using Kafka as the event bus. Services will publish domain events (e.g., OrderCreated, MenuUpdated, DriverLocation) to topics. Subscribers can process events asynchronously.

== Consequences

* Positive:
** Loose coupling between services improves resilience.
** High throughput and buffering capabilities handle burst traffic.
** Event sourcing provides an audit log for analytics and troubleshooting.

* Negative:
** Increased complexity in handling eventual consistency and error handling.
** Operational overhead of managing Kafka clusters.
