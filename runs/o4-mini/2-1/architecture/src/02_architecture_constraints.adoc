== Architecture Constraints

This section summarizes all relevant architectural constraints (nonfunctional requirements, technology restrictions, organizational requirements). These define the boundaries within which the architects must work.

=== Nonfunctional Constraints
* Scalability: Must handle rapid auto-scaling to support flash loads.
* Real-time capabilities: Sub-2-second update latency.
* High availability: Target of â‰¥99.9% uptime.
* Security: TLS encryption, OAuth2/JWT auth, PCI DSS compliance for payment data.
* Interoperability: Must integrate with external services like Stripe, Google Maps.
* Maintainability: Services loosely coupled, independent CI/CD pipelines.
* Observability: End-to-end tracing, centralized logs, real-time metrics/alerting.

=== Technological Constraints
* Containerization on Kubernetes.
* Cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP/Azure) with Terraform.
* Primary databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB; cache: Redis.
* Messaging: Kafka (or RabbitMQ).
* API Gateway: Kong/Envoy/NGINX.
