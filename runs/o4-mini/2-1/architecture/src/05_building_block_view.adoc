=== Level 1: Whitebox Overall System

The overall system is decomposed into independent microservices, supporting clear service boundaries, independent deployability, and scalability. All external clients interact through the API Gateway, which handles cross-cutting concerns. Services communicate synchronously via REST/gRPC and asynchronously via an event bus. Persistent stores and caches support each service's data needs.

Motivation::
By decomposing into focused, independently deployable services and an event-driven backbone, we achieve loose coupling, scalability, and resilience. The clear separation of concerns aligns with organizational team boundaries.

Contained Building Blocks::

|===
|Name|Responsibility
|API Gateway|Central entry point for all client requests. Handles routing, auth, rate limiting, TLS termination.
|Auth & Identity Service|Manages user authentication, token issuance (OAuth2/JWT), and role-based access control.
|Customer Service|Manages customer profiles, favorites, order history, and reviews. Caches hot data for performance.
|Restaurant Service|Manages restaurant profiles, menus, availability, and financial reports. Publishes menu events.
|Order Service|Orchestrates order lifecycle, state transitions, and saga-based workflows. Ensures strong consistency of orders.
|Driver Service|Manages driver profiles, status, availability, and geolocation tracking. Calculates routing via Mapping Service.
|Payment Service|Handles payment intents, authorizations, and captures. Integrates with external payment provider with idempotency.
|Notification Service|Subscribes to domain events and delivers notifications via push, WebSocket, and in-app messages.
|Mapping & Routing Service|Wraps external mapping APIs for geocoding, routing, and ETA calculations.
|Event Bus (Kafka)|Provides asynchronous, high-throughput event distribution between services.
|PostgreSQL|Primary datastore for strongly consistent data (orders, payments).
|MongoDB|Primary datastore for document-oriented data (customers, restaurants, drivers).
|Redis Cache|In-memory cache and session store for low-latency data access and geo-queries.
|Object Storage (S3)|Stores static assets (menu images, receipts) and large volumes of unstructured data.

Important Interfaces::
* API Gateway → Services: REST/HTTP+JSON or gRPC
* Services ↔ Event Bus: Kafka topics for domain events (OrderCreated, MenuUpdated, DriverLocation)
* Order Service ↔ Payment Service: synchronous API call for payment intents
* Driver Service ↔ Mapping Service: REST calls to external Maps API
