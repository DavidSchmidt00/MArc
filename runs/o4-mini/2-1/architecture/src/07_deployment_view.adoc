== Deployment View

The system is deployed to a cloud environment (AWS/GCP/Azure) using Kubernetes for container orchestration. Each microservice is packaged as a Docker container and deployed as pods across multiple availability zones for resilience.

Nodes:
* Load Balancer: Distributes incoming requests across the API Gateway replicas.
* Kubernetes Cluster: Hosts all service pods with Horizontal Pod Autoscaling.
* PostgreSQL Cluster: Managed, multi-AZ primary database for strong consistency.
* MongoDB Cluster: Managed, sharded document store for flexible data.
* Kafka Cluster: Self-managed or managed streaming platform for events.
* Redis Cluster: Caching and session store for low-latency access.
* S3 Bucket: Stores static assets and large binary objects.

Networking:
* All service communication secured via mTLS.
* VPC and subnet isolation for database and messaging clusters.

Scalability & Resilience:
* Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for dynamic scaling based on CPU, memory, and custom metrics (e.g., Kafka lag).
* Multi-AZ deployment for pods and data clusters to meet SLA (â‰¥99.9% uptime).
