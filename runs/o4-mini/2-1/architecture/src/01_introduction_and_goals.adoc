== Introduction and Goals

=== Requirements Overview
In the three-sided "Fork & Knife" delivery platform, the system must connect Customers, Restaurants, and Delivery Drivers through a unified backend composed of independent services. Key functional requirements include:
* Customer-facing ordering (browse, filter, cart, payment, real-time tracking).
* Restaurant portal (menu management, order acceptance, availability, reporting).
* Driver app (job offers, optimized routing, status updates).
* Platform administration (user support, monitoring, payment reconciliations).

These requirements drive the need for a scalable, real-time, and reliable microservice architecture supporting web and mobile clients.
