== Solution Strategy

To meet the systemâ€™s functional requirements and quality goals, we adopt a cloud-native microservice architecture, an event-driven backbone, and a robust API gateway at the edge. Key strategy points:

* Microservices Decomposition
** Each core domain is implemented as an independent microservice (Auth & Identity, Customer, Restaurant, Order, Driver, Payment, Notification, Mapping & Routing).
** Services have dedicated datastores to achieve loose coupling and independent scalability.

* API Gateway
** Central reverse proxy (Envoy/Kong) provides TLS termination, request routing, authentication/authorization, rate limiting, protocol translation, and WebSocket/SSE proxying.
** BFF patterns allow per-client request aggregation.

* Event-Driven Integration
** Kafka-based event bus decouples services and supports high-throughput, asynchronous communication.
** Domain events (OrderCreated, MenuUpdated, DriverLocation, PaymentCompleted) drive notifications and analytics.

* Data Management
** Relational DB (PostgreSQL) for strongly consistent domains (orders, payments).
** Document DB (MongoDB) for flexible schemas (customers, restaurants, drivers).
** Redis for caching, session store, geo-queries and rate-limiter state.
** Object storage (S3) for static assets (menu images, receipts).

* Resilience & Scalability
** Stateless containers deployed on Kubernetes across multiple availability zones with horizontal autoscaling.
** Circuit breakers, retries, bulkheads, and backpressure protect services under load.
** Saga pattern coordinates distributed transactions (order + payment + inventory + driver assignment).

* Observability & DevOps
** GitOps pipelines ensure repeatable, controlled deployments (Terraform, Helm).
** Centralized logging (ELK), metrics (Prometheus/Grafana), and distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry/Jaeger).
** CI-driven security validation for WAF rules and feature-flag configurations.
