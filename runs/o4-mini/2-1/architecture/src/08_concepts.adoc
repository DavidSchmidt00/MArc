== Cross-Cutting Concepts

This section outlines key architectural concepts and patterns employed across multiple parts of the system.

=== Microservices
• Decomposition of the platform into independently deployable services aligned to core domains (Customer, Restaurant, Order, Driver, Payment).  
• Each service has its own datastore and CI/CD pipeline, reducing coupling and supporting autonomous team ownership.

=== API Gateway Pattern
• Single entry point for all client interactions.  
• Handles authentication/authorization (OAuth2/JWT), TLS termination, routing, rate limiting, and request validation.

=== Event-Driven Architecture
• Asynchronous communication via Kafka event bus.  
• Services publish domain events (OrderCreated, MenuUpdated, DriverLocation) to decouple producers from consumers.  
• Supports high throughput, resilience under load, and eventual consistency where appropriate.

=== Saga Pattern for Distributed Transactions
• Manages long-running workflows (order placement, payment, driver assignment) without two-phase commit.  
• Each step publishes compensating events in case of failures, preserving data consistency across services.

=== CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
• Separates write models (commands via REST/gRPC) from read models (query-optimized views via cache or event sourcing).  
• Improves performance and scalability of read-heavy operations (e.g., customer browsing, driver lists).

=== Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)
• Isolates core business logic from infrastructure concerns.  
• Facilitates testing and replacement of external integrations (databases, message brokers, third-party APIs).

=== Containerization & Orchestration
• All services are packaged as Docker containers and deployed on Kubernetes.  
• Infrastructure provisioned via Terraform, with GitOps-driven CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment and rollback.

=== Observability & Resilience Patterns
• Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry), centralized logging (ELK), metrics/alerts (Prometheus/Grafana).  
• Resilience patterns: circuit breakers, retries with backoff, bulkheads to isolate resource pools.

=== Security & Compliance
• mTLS for inter-service communication, OAuth2/JWT for client authentication.  
• PCI DSS compliance for payment processing, encryption at rest for sensitive data.  
• Rate limiting and WAF rules at the API Gateway to mitigate abuse and DDoS.
