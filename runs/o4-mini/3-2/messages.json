            "content": "{\"status\": \"success\", \"content\": \"# \\\"InsureSphere CRM\\\" Integration\\n\\n## Project Description\\n\\nThe \\\"InsureSphere CRM\\\" project involves building a new, modern Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system for a large, established insurance company. The primary goal is to create a 360-degree view of the customer for sales agents and support staff. This system must be deeply integrated into the company's existing, complex IT landscape.\\n\\n## Context\\n\\nThe insurance company currently uses a collection of outdated, siloed systems to manage customer information. Sales agents have to access multiple different applications to get a full picture of a customer's policies, claims history, and interactions. This is inefficient and leads to poor customer service. \\\"InsureSphere CRM\\\" will replace several legacy front-office applications and act as the central hub for all customer-related activities.\\n\\n## Key Stakeholders\\n\\n- **Insurance Agents (Sales & Renewals)**: Primary users who need a unified view of their customers.\\n- **Customer Support Representatives**: Users who handle customer inquiries and claims.\\n- **Underwriting Department**: Needs access to customer data to assess risk.\\n- **Marketing Department**: Will use the CRM for campaign management and customer segmentation.\\n- **IT Operations & Compliance**: Responsible for maintaining the existing systems and ensuring the new CRM meets strict regulatory and security standards.\\n\\n## User Stories\\n\\n### Agent & Support Stories\\n\\n- As an insurance agent, I want to search for a customer by name, policy number, or phone number and see all their personal details, active policies, claims history, and past interactions on a single, consolidated dashboard.\\n- As an insurance agent, I want to see a visual timeline of the customer's journey, including policy start dates, claims, and major life events.\\n- As an insurance agent, I want to receive automated alerts and tasks in my work queue for key customer events, such as an upcoming policy renewal, a missed payment, or a birthday.\\n- As an insurance agent, I want to be able to generate a new insurance quote for an existing customer, pre-filling their data from the system.\\n- As a customer support rep, I want to log every interaction with a customer (phone call, email, chat) in the CRM, so that any colleague can see the complete, up-to-date history.\\n- As a customer support rep, I want to use pre-defined email and chat templates for common inquiries to respond faster and more consistently.\\n- As a customer support rep, I want to initiate the first notice of loss (FNOL) for a new claim directly from the customer's profile, which then triggers a workflow in the downstream claims system.\\n\\n### Underwriting & Marketing Stories\\n\\n- As an underwriter, I want to access a \\\"customer-at-a-glance\\\" report from the CRM that pulls in relevant risk data from the policy and claims systems.\\n- As an underwriter, I want to see a system-generated risk score for a customer that is calculated based on data from multiple integrated systems.\\n- As a marketing manager, I want to create dynamic customer segments based on any data in the CRM (e.g., \\\"all customers in Hessen with a car and home policy whose renewal is in the next 90 days\\\").\\n- As a marketing manager, I want to export these segments to our external email marketing platform (e.g., Salesforce Marketing Cloud) to run targeted campaigns.\\n- As a marketing manager, I want to see the results of marketing campaigns (e.g., open rates, policies sold) reflected back in the CRM to calculate ROI.\\n\\n## Quality Attributes\\n\\n- **Integration & Interoperability**: This is the most critical quality attribute. The CRM must seamlessly and reliably integrate with the core policy management system (running on a mainframe), the claims processing system (a Java-based application), the billing system (AS/400), and the corporate data warehouse (Teradata).\\n- **Data Consistency & Integrity**: The CRM must ensure that data is consistent across all integrated systems. A change of address in the CRM must be propagated correctly and in a timely manner to all relevant backend systems.\\n- **Security & Compliance**: The system will handle highly sensitive personal and financial data. It must comply with industry regulations (e.g., BaFin in Germany, GDPR) and pass rigorous security audits.\\n- **Reliability**: The system must be highly reliable, as it will be a mission-critical application for the company's front-office operations.\\n- **Usability**: Despite the complexity behind the scenes, the user interface for agents must be modern, intuitive, and efficient to reduce training time and improve adoption.\\n\\n## Additional Information Important for the Project\\n\\nThe architecture will be heavily influenced by the integration patterns required to connect to the legacy systems. This will likely involve a mix of approaches:\\n\\n- An Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) or a modern Integration Platform might be used to orchestrate data flows.\\n- APIs will be used where available.\\n- Data-level integration (e.g., scheduled batch jobs, database replication) might be necessary for systems that do not expose APIs.\\n- An Anti-Corruption Layer will be crucial to isolate the new CRM's domain model from the complexities and inconsistencies of the legacy systems.\\n- A phased rollout strategy will be necessary, starting with a pilot group of users and gradually migrating more users and functionality to the new system.\\n- Significant effort must be allocated to data migration, including data cleansing and transformation from the old systems to the new CRM.\"}",

            "content": "Below is a set of Architecturally Significant Requirements (ASRs) extracted from the project description, user stories, quality attributes, and integration constraints. Each ASR is given an identifier, a concise requirement statement, its rationale/impact, and any measurable acceptance criteria.\n\n1. ASR-INT-001: Seamless Integration via ESB  \n   • Statement: All synchronous and asynchronous interactions with legacy systems (mainframe policy system, Java claims system, AS/400 billing, Teradata DW) shall be routed through a central Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) or modern integration platform.  \n   • Rationale: Centralizes message routing, protocol translation, error handling, and monitoring.  \n   • Acceptance Criteria:  \n     – 95% of calls to legacy systems succeed end-to-end (request→response) within 1 second.  \n     – ESB provides retry and dead-letter capabilities for failed messages.\n\n2. ASR-INT-002: Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL)  \n   • Statement: The CRM domain model shall be isolated from legacy data models via an ACL that performs translation, validation, and enrichment of incoming/outgoing data.  \n   • Rationale: Prevents propagation of legacy inconsistencies and shields core CRM services from upstream changes.  \n   • Acceptance Criteria:  \n     – Model mismatches caught and logged 100% of the time with no direct coupling.  \n     – New legacy system interfaces added by updating only the ACL layer, with no changes to CRM core services.\n\n3. ASR-DATA-001: Near-Real-Time Data Consistency  \n   • Statement: Any update in customer master data (e.g., address change) must be propagated to all integrated systems under eventual consistency, with an SLA of ≤ 5 minutes.  \n   • Rationale: Ensures front-office users always see up-to-date customer information.  \n   • Acceptance Criteria:  \n     – End-to-end propagation measured under 5 minutes in 99% of tests.  \n     – Conflict resolution rules defined for concurrent updates.\n\n4. ASR-SEC-001: End-to-End Encryption & Audit Logging  \n   • Statement: All data in transit shall use TLS 1.2+; all sensitive data at rest must be encrypted (AES-256). All CRUD operations on personal data must be logged with user, timestamp, and record ID.  \n   • Rationale: Meets GDPR and BaFin requirements for data protection and traceability.  \n   • Acceptance Criteria:  \n     – No unencrypted channels in use (scan = zero findings).  \n     – Audit logs cover 100% of create/update/delete events for PII.\n\n5. ASR-SEC-002: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) & Separation of Duties  \n   • Statement: The CRM shall enforce RBAC with at least four roles (Agent, Support Rep, Underwriter, Marketing Manager) and ensure that no user can perform actions outside their assigned privileges.  \n   • Rationale: Limits data access in accordance with compliance requirements.  \n   • Acceptance Criteria:  \n     – Penetration tests confirm no privilege escalation.  \n     – Access reviews produce zero unauthorized operations.\n\n6. ASR-AVAIL-001: High Availability & Disaster Recovery  \n   • Statement: The CRM core services shall be deployed in an active–active cluster across two datacenters, providing ≥ 99.9% uptime, and a Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of ≤ 4 hours.  \n   • Rationale: Mission-critical for front-office operations.  \n   • Acceptance Criteria:  \n     – Simulated failover completes within 4 hours with no data loss.  \n     – Monthly availability reports ≥ 99.9%.\n\n7. ASR-PERF-001: Front-End Responsiveness  \n   • Statement: All primary dashboard views and search results shall render in ≤ 2 seconds under a load of 2,000 concurrent users.  \n   • Rationale: Supports high usability and adoption by agents.  \n   • Acceptance Criteria:  \n     – Load tests confirm 95th-percentile page-load times ≤ 2 seconds.\n\n8. ASR-SCAL-001: Horizontal Scalability of Services  \n   • Statement: CRM microservices must scale horizontally to handle a 3× increase in transaction volumes (peak 6,000 concurrent users) without code changes.  \n   • Rationale: Future-proofing for business growth and marketing campaigns.  \n   • Acceptance Criteria:  \n     – Auto-scaling policies trigger new instances when CPU > 70%; end-to-end throughput sustained.\n\n9. ASR-USAB-001: Intuitive, Modern UI Framework  \n   • Statement: The user interface shall be built on a component-based framework (e.g., React or Angular) supporting role-specific dashboards, theming, and low-code customization of templates.  \n   • Rationale: Reduces training time and empowers business users to adapt workflows.  \n   • Acceptance Criteria:  \n     – Usability testing yields an average SUS score ≥ 80.  \n     – UI components are reusable for all user roles.\n\n10. ASR-DATA-MIG-001: Data Migration & Cleansing  \n    • Statement: Legacy customer, policy, and claims data must be migrated through an automated ETL pipeline that applies cleansing rules, deduplication, and transformation into the CRM schema.  \n    • Rationale: Ensures a smooth phased rollout and high data quality.  \n    • Acceptance Criteria:  \n      – 99% of legacy records successfully mapped and loaded.  \n      – Migration scripts support idempotence and can be re-run without duplicating data.\n\n11. ASR-MON-001: Centralized Monitoring & Alerting  \n    • Statement: All services, ESB flows, and integration endpoints must emit standardized metrics and logs to a central monitoring platform with alerts on SLA breaches, error rates > 1%, and security incidents.  \n    • Rationale: Enables proactive operations and rapid incident response.  \n    • Acceptance Criteria:  \n      – Alerting latency < 1 minute.  \n      – 100% coverage of critical transaction paths in dashboards.\n\n12. ASR-COMPLIANCE-001: Audit & Regulatory Reporting  \n    • Statement: The system must provide out-of-the-box reports for GDPR data access requests, BaFin audit trails, and periodic compliance checks.  \n    • Rationale: Simplifies regulatory reporting and reduces manual effort.  \n    • Acceptance Criteria:  \n      – Automated generation of required reports with no manual data extraction.\n\nThese ASRs capture the key architectural drivers for integration, performance, security, reliability, usability, scalability, and compliance. They form the foundation for the next design phase.",

            "content": "Below is a high-level, end-to-end architecture for InsureSphere CRM. It balances loose coupling (to legacy), scalability, availability, security, and a modern UI—all driven by the ASRs we defined.\n\n1. Logical Layers & Major Components  \n   1.1. Client Tier  \n       • SPA Front-end (React/Angular) behind an API Gateway  \n       • Role-based dashboards (Agent, Support, Underwriter, Marketing)  \n       • Real-time notifications via WebSockets or Server-Sent Events  \n   1.2. API & Integration Tier  \n       • API Gateway (e.g., Kong, Zuul)  \n         – Routing, authentication, rate-limiting, logging  \n       • Enterprise Service Bus / Integration Platform (ESB)  \n         – Protocol translation, orchestration, retry, DLQ  \n         – Connectors to:  \n            • Mainframe Policy System (via MQ or batch exports)  \n            • Java Claims System (SOAP/REST)  \n            • AS/400 Billing (FTP/DB replication)  \n            • Teradata DWH (JDBC/ODBC, CDC)  \n       • Message Broker (e.g., Kafka) for event-driven propagation  \n       • Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL)  \n         – Adapters/mappers for each legacy interface  \n         – Validation, enrichment, canonical data model  \n   1.3. Domain Microservices Tier  \n       • Customer Service  \n       • Policy Service  \n       • Claims-Initiation Service  \n       • Interaction & Activity Service  \n       • Marketing & Segmentation Service  \n       • Risk-Scoring Service  \n       – Each built as a hexagonal-style microservice with:  \n          • Internal domain model & business logic  \n          • Inbound ports (REST, Events) & outbound adapters  \n          • Local data store (polyglot persistence)  \n   1.4. Data Management Tier  \n       • Online Stores (per-service relational/NoSQL)  \n       • Distributed Cache (Redis) for high-speed lookups  \n       • ETL/Data-Migration Pipeline  \n         – Automated cleansing, dedupe, idempotent loads  \n       • Near-Real-Time Sync  \n         – Change Data Capture (CDC) → Kafka → microservices  \n   1.5. Cross-Cutting Services  \n       • Security & Compliance  \n         – OAuth2/OIDC, RBAC via Identity Provider (Keycloak)  \n         – TLS everywhere, AES-256 at rest, audit-logging service  \n       • Monitoring & Observability  \n         – Metrics (Prometheus), Logs (ELK/EFK), Tracing (Jaeger)  \n         – SLA & error-rate alerts (<1-min latency)  \n       • CI/CD & Infrastructure  \n         – Kubernetes clusters (active-active across 2 DCs)  \n         – Auto-scaling policies, blue-green deployments  \n       • Disaster Recovery  \n         – Automated backups, RTO ≤ 4h, RPO aligned with CDC  \n       • Reporting & BI  \n         – Data warehouse feeds for GDPR/BaFin reports  \n         – Export segments to Marketing Cloud via secure API  \n\n2. Key Architectural Patterns & Styles  \n   • Microservices + Hexagonal Architecture  \n     – Enforces clear boundaries, testability, horizontal scaling  \n   • Event-Driven Integration (Kafka)  \n     – Near-real-time data consistency (≤5 min SLA)  \n     – Decoupled producers/consumers for resilience  \n   • API Gateway & ESB  \n     – Separates public API surface from legacy choreography  \n     – Centralized security, routing, transformation  \n   • Anti-Corruption Layer  \n     – Shields CRM domain from legacy model drift and complexity  \n   • CQRS (optional for heavy read scenarios)  \n     – Could be applied to timeline and segmentation queries to optimize performance  \n\n3. Data Flow (Example “Change Address” Scenario)  \n   1. Agent updates address in CRM UI → REST POST → API GW  \n   2. Request routed to Customer Service → persist locally → emit “CustomerUpdated” event to Kafka  \n   3. ESB subscribes to “CustomerUpdated” → invokes ACL adapter → calls legacy systems via their connectors  \n   4. ESB tracks success/failure, retries or pushes to DLQ  \n   5. Audit-log entry written; UI updated via WebSocket for all open sessions  \n\n4. How This Addresses the ASRs  \n   • ASR-INT-001 / INT-002: ESB + ACL centralize and isolate all integration logic  \n   • ASR-DATA-001: CDC → Kafka → services delivers <5 min propagation  \n   • ASR-SEC-001 / SEC-002: TLS+AES, OAuth2, RBAC, full audit logs  \n   • ASR-AVAIL-001: Kubernetes active-active, auto-heal, RTO ≤ 4 h  \n   • ASR-PERF-001 / SCAL-001: Microservices + Redis + auto-scaling; 2 000 users at sub-2 s  \n   • ASR-USAB-001: Modern SPA, reusable component library, SUS ≥ 80  \n   • ASR-DATA-MIG-001: Automated ETL with idempotence, 99% mapping success  \n   • ASR-MON-001: Prometheus/ELK, 1-min alerting on SLA breaches  \n   • ASR-COMPLIANCE-001: Built-in reporting, GDPR/BaFin extracts  \n\n5. Phased Rollout Strategy  \n   • Phase 1: Pilot – Customer & Interaction services + core integration  \n   • Phase 2: Expand to Policy & Claims initiation  \n   • Phase 3: Add Marketing & Risk scoring  \n   • Phase 4: Cutover legacy front-office UIs; full decommission  \n\nThis design provides a robust, scalable, and maintainable CRM backbone that meets all critical integration, security, reliability, performance, and usability requirements. It is now ready for detailed component design and review.",
