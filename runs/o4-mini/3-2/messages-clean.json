The primary goal is to create a 360-degree view of the customer for sales agents and support staff. This system must be deeply integrated into the company's existing, complex IT landscape.\\n\\n## Context\\n\\nThe insurance company currently uses a collection of outdated, siloed systems to manage customer information. Sales agents have to access multiple different applications to get a full picture of a customer's policies, claims history, and interactions. This is inefficient and leads to poor customer service. \\\"InsureSphere CRM\\\" will replace several legacy front-office applications and act as the central hub for all customer-related activities.\\n\\n## Key Stakeholders\\n\\n- **Insurance Agents (Sales & Renewals)**: Primary users who need a unified view of their customers.\\n- **Customer Support Representatives**: Users who handle customer inquiries and claims.\\n- **Underwriting Department**: Needs access to customer data to assess risk.\\n- **Marketing Department**: Will use the CRM for campaign management and customer segmentation.\\n- **IT Operations & Compliance**: Responsible for maintaining the existing systems and ensuring the new CRM meets strict regulatory and security standards.\\n\\n## User Stories\\n\\n### Agent & Support Stories\\n\\n- As an insurance agent, I want to search for a customer by name, policy number, or phone number and see all their personal details, active policies, claims history, and past interactions on a single, consolidated dashboard.\\n- As an insurance agent, I want to see a visual timeline of the customer's journey, including policy start dates, claims, and major life events.\\n- As an insurance agent, I want to receive automated alerts and tasks in my work queue for key customer events, such as an upcoming policy renewal, a missed payment, or a birthday.\\n- As an insurance agent, I want to be able to generate a new insurance quote for an existing customer, pre-filling their data from the system.\\n- As a customer support rep, I want to log every interaction with a customer (phone call, email, chat) in the CRM, so that any colleague can see the complete, up-to-date history.\\n- As a customer support rep, I want to use pre-defined email and chat templates for common inquiries to respond faster and more consistently.\\n- As a customer support rep, I want to initiate the first notice of loss (FNOL) for a new claim directly from the customer's profile, which then triggers a workflow in the downstream claims system.\\n\\n### Underwriting & Marketing Stories\\n\\n- As an underwriter, I want to access a \\\"customer-at-a-glance\\\" report from the CRM that pulls in relevant risk data from the policy and claims systems.\\n- As an underwriter, I want to see a system-generated risk score for a customer that is calculated based on data from multiple integrated systems.\\n- As a marketing manager, I want to create dynamic customer segments based on any data in the CRM (e.g., \\\"all customers in Hessen with a car and home policy whose renewal is in the next 90 days\\\").\\n- As a marketing manager, I want to export these segments to our external email marketing platform (e.g., Salesforce Marketing Cloud) to run targeted campaigns.\\n- As a marketing manager, I want to see the results of marketing campaigns (e.g., open rates, policies sold) reflected back in the CRM to calculate ROI.\\n\\n## Quality Attributes\\n\\n- **Integration & Interoperability**: This is the most critical quality attribute. The CRM must seamlessly and reliably integrate with the core policy management system (running on a mainframe), the claims processing system (a Java-based application), the billing system (AS/400), and the corporate data warehouse (Teradata).\\n- **Data Consistency & Integrity**: The CRM must ensure that data is consistent across all integrated systems. A change of address in the CRM must be propagated correctly and in a timely manner to all relevant backend systems.\\n- **Security & Compliance**: The system will handle highly sensitive personal and financial data. It must comply with industry regulations (e.g., BaFin in Germany, GDPR) and pass rigorous security audits.\\n- **Reliability**: The system must be highly reliable, as it will be a mission-critical application for the company's front-office operations.\\n- **Usability**: Despite the complexity behind the scenes, the user interface for agents must be modern, intuitive, and efficient to reduce training time and improve adoption.\\n\\n## Additional Information Important for the Project\\n\\nThe architecture will be heavily influenced by the integration patterns required to connect to the legacy systems. This will likely involve a mix of approaches:\\n\\n- An Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) or a modern Integration Platform might be used to orchestrate data flows.\\n- APIs will be used where available.\\n- Data-level integration (e.g., scheduled batch jobs, database replication) might be necessary for systems that do not expose APIs.\\n- An Anti-Corruption Layer will be crucial to isolate the new CRM's domain model from the complexities and inconsistencies of the legacy systems.\\n- A phased rollout strategy will be necessary, starting with a pilot group of users and gradually migrating more users and functionality to the new system.\\n- Significant effort must be allocated to data migration, including data cleansing and transformation from the old systems to the new CRM.\"}",
