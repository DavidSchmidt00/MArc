== Concepts

This section defines key architectural and domain concepts employed in the InsureSphere CRM solution.

=== Microservices & Hexagonal Architecture
*Bounded Contexts*: Each domain area (Customer, Policy, Claims, Interaction, Marketing, Risk) is isolated in its own service.  
*Hexagonal Pattern*: Services expose inbound ports (REST, events) and interact with infrastructure via outbound adapters. Business logic remains independent of frameworks.

=== API Gateway
A central gateway provides a unified API surface, handles authentication (OAuth2/OIDC), authorization (RBAC), routing to microservices, rate-limiting, and request logging.

=== Event-Driven Architecture (Kafka)
Domain events are published to Kafka topics for asynchronous, decoupled integration and near-real-time data consistency.  
Services and ESB connectors subscribe to relevant topics.

=== Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)
A corporate ESB handles synchronous (MQ, SOAP/REST) and asynchronous (batch, CDC) communication with legacy systems.  
The ESB provides protocol translation, orchestration, retry logic, and dead-letter queues.

=== Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL)
An ACL between ESB adapters and CRM microservices transforms and validates legacy data models into the CRM’s canonical domain model, shielding microservices from legacy inconsistencies.

=== Change Data Capture (CDC)
Legacy databases emit change events via CDC connectors.  
Events are streamed to Kafka to synchronize microservice data stores and support the CRM’s near-real-time consistency SLA.

=== CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
Optionally applied for high-load read scenarios (timelines, segment queries) by separating read stores from write models.

=== Containerization & Kubernetes
All components (services, connectors, ACL, ETL jobs) are packaged as Docker containers and orchestrated by Kubernetes in an active–active, multi-datacenter setup.

=== Security & Compliance
Authentication and authorization use OAuth2/OIDC and RBAC.  
All data in transit is encrypted (TLS), data at rest is encrypted (AES-256), and all PII operations are audit-logged to meet GDPR and BaFin requirements.
