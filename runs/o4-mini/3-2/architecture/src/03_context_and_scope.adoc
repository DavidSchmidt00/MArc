== Context and Scope

This section describes the system in its environment and identifies the relevant external systems and stakeholders.

=== System Scope
The InsureSphere CRM serves as the central front-office application for all customer-related activities within the insurance company. It replaces multiple legacy customer-facing UIs and fosters a unified interaction. It does not replace core policy or claims business logic; rather, it integrates and orchestrates interactions with existing systems.

=== External Entities
[options="header",cols="1,3,3"]
|===
|External Entity|Description|Interaction
|Mainframe Policy System|Legacy policy management on an IBM mainframe|Query/update policy data via ESB (MQ/REST)
|Java Claims System|Existing claims processing application|Initiate FNOL workflow; fetch claims history (SOAP/REST)
|AS/400 Billing System|Legacy billing & invoicing on AS/400|Fetch billing data, scheduled batch updates
|Teradata Data Warehouse|Corporate analytics platform|CDC-based near-real-time data feed into CRM
|Marketing Cloud|External email marketing platform|Export/import dynamic customer segments
|Identity Provider (OAuth2/OIDC)|Authentication and authorization service|User login, role assignment, JWT issuance
|Prometheus / ELK / Jaeger|Monitoring & observability tools|Metrics, logs, and traces ingestion
|===

=== Key Interfaces
* RESTful APIs exposed by CRM for all client interactions (search, dashboard, alerts)
* GraphQL (optional) for advanced segmentation queries
* Event bus (Kafka topics) for internal event distribution (e.g., CustomerUpdated)
* ESB endpoints for legacy integration

=== In-Scope vs Out-of-Scope
*In Scope*: Front-end SPA, API Gateway, CRM microservices, ESB adapters, data migration pipeline, monitoring, security, and compliance features.
*Out of Scope*: Core policy/claims/billing business logic; external data warehouse transformations not related to CRM; standalone marketing automation beyond segment export.
