== Solution Strategy

To address the business needs and architectural drivers for InsureSphere CRM, we adopt the following overarching strategies:

=== Microservices & Hexagonal Architecture
• Decompose domain into bounded contexts (Customer, Policy, Claims, Interaction, Marketing, Risk).  
• Implement each context as an independent microservice with clear inbound/outbound ports and adapters.  
• Isolate business logic from frameworks and infrastructure concerns for testability and maintainability.

=== Event-Driven Data Propagation
• Use Kafka as the event backbone to ensure near-real-time data consistency (≤5min SLA).  
• Producers (microservices and legacy CDC feeds) publish domain events (e.g., CustomerUpdated).  
• Consumers subscribe to topics to update local stores, caches, or trigger workflows.

=== API Gateway & ESB Integration
• Front public APIs through an API Gateway for routing, authentication, rate-limiting, and logging.  
• Legacy system interactions are encapsulated in ESB adapters (MQ, SOAP, batch) behind the ACL.  
• This separation ensures modern protocols for CRM-exclusive endpoints and legacy-specific protocols remain decoupled.

=== Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL)
• Introduce an ACL between ESB adapters and CRM microservices to map legacy models to the canonical domain model.  
• Provides validation, enrichment, error handling, and shielding from legacy inconsistencies.

=== Stateless Containers & Kubernetes
• Package microservices, ESB connectors, and ancillary services in Docker containers.  
• Deploy to Kubernetes for auto-scaling, self-healing, and active–active across two data centers.

=== Security & Compliance by Design
• Implement OAuth2/OIDC for authentication, enforce RBAC in the Gateway and services.  
• Encrypt all data in transit with TLS 1.2+ and at rest with AES-256.  
• Centralize audit logs for all PII operations and ensure traceability.

=== CI/CD & Observability
• Use automated pipelines (build→test→canary→production) for all services.  
• Integrate Prometheus, ELK, and Jaeger for full-stack observability and alerting.  

This strategy directly addresses the key quality goals: interoperability, data integrity, security, availability, performance, and usability.
