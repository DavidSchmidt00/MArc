== Introduction and Goals

InsureSphere CRM is a modern, front-office Customer Relationship Management system tailored for a large insurance company. Its primary objective is to provide a 360° view of customers—combining personal details, policies, claims history, interactions, and marketing segments—through a single, unified interface. The CRM replaces multiple legacy applications and integrates with mainframe policy systems, Java-based claims systems, AS/400 billing, and a Teradata data warehouse.

=== Requirements Overview
*Unified Customer View*: Search by name, policy number, phone, and display consolidated dashboards with personal data, active policies, claims, interactions, and journey timelines.
*Automated Workflows & Alerts*: Trigger renewal reminders, missed payments, birthdays; support FNOL initiation and task generation.
*Quote Generation*: Pre-fill data for new quotes based on existing customer records.
*Interaction Logging*: Log calls, emails, chats with templates for consistent responses.
*Underwriting & Marketing*: Generate at-a-glance risk reports, calculate risk scores, create dynamic segments, and export to external marketing platforms. Reflect campaign results back into CRM.
*Data Migration & Cleansing*: Automated ETL to cleanse and dedupe legacy data into the new schema.
