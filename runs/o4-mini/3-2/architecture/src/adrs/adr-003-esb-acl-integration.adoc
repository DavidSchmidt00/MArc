= ADR-003: Legacy Integration via ESB and ACL

== Context
Multiple legacy systems (mainframe, Java claims, AS/400 billing, Teradata DWH) with distinct protocols and data models must integrate with the new CRM without tightly coupling.

== Decision
We will route all legacy interactions through the corporate ESB and encapsulate protocol handling in ESB connectors. An Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL) between the ESB and CRM microservices will map legacy data models to the CRMâ€™s canonical domain model.

== Consequences
Positive:
* Isolation of legacy complexities.
* Centralized retry, DLQ, and monitoring of legacy calls.

Negative:
* Added latency for ACL transformations.
* Extra layer to maintain and test.

Neutral:
* Enforces clear separation between new and old domains.
