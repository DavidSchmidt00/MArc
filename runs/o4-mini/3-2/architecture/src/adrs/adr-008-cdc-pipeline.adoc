= ADR-008: Change Data Capture (CDC) Pipeline

== Context
Legacy databases do not provide APIs for near-real-time data access. Batch updates introduce delays that break the data consistency SLA (â‰¤5min).

== Decision
We will deploy CDC connectors (e.g., Debezium) on legacy databases to stream change events to Kafka. Microservices subscribe to relevant topics to update their local data stores.

== Consequences
Positive:
* Ensures near-real-time data sync.
* Avoids direct scheduling of batch jobs.

Negative:
* Operational overhead of running CDC connectors.
* Management of connector offsets and backpressure.

Neutral:
* Requires careful schema change management.
