= ADR-006: OAuth2/OIDC Authentication & RBAC

== Context
The CRM solution handles sensitive personal and financial data requiring strict authentication, authorization, and auditability according to GDPR and BaFin regulations.

== Decision
We will integrate with the corporate OAuth2/OIDC Identity Provider (Keycloak) for authentication and use JWT tokens with embedded RBAC claims. Each service and the API Gateway will validate tokens and enforce role-based access control.

== Consequences
Positive:
* Centralized user and role management.
* Consistent security policies across services.

Negative:
* Dependency on the IDPâ€™s availability and configuration.

Neutral:
* Aligns with corporate security standards.
