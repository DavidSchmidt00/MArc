= ADR-009: CI/CD with Blue-Green & Canary Deployments

== Context
Frequent releases and updates must occur with minimal downtime and risk. The architecture spans multiple microservices and infrastructure components, making coordinating deployments a challenge.

== Decision
Implement a CI/CD pipeline using Git-based triggers, automated builds, and tests. Deploy using blue-green or canary strategies: 
* Blue-Green for backend and database migrations to switch traffic between identical environments.  
* Canary for incremental rollout of new service versions, monitoring key metrics before full promotion.

== Consequences
Positive:
* Reduced downtime and deployment risk.  
* Early detection of issues via canary monitoring.
* Standardized release process.

Negative:
* Increased complexity in pipeline configuration and environment management.  
* Additional infrastructure for parallel environments.

Neutral:
* Requires cultural adoption of GitOps and automation best practices.
