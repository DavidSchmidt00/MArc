= ADR-004: API Gateway for External Exposure

== Context
All client applications (agent UI, support UI, marketing dashboards) require consistent authentication, authorization, routing, and observability.

== Decision
We will front all external and internal API calls with an API Gateway solution (e.g., Kong or Zuul). It will handle OAuth2 token validation, RBAC enforcement, rate-limiting, logging, and request routing to individual microservices.

== Consequences
Positive:
* Single point for cross-cutting concerns.
* Simplified client configuration and security.

Negative:
* Potential single point of failure (mitigated via HA).  
* Extra network hop and processing.

Neutral:
* Encourages standardized API design.
