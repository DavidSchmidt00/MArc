= ADR-002: Event-Driven Integration with Kafka

== Context
Customer data updates and events from legacy systems must propagate to microservices in near-real-time (â‰¤5min SLA) to maintain data consistency and support asynchronous workflows.

== Decision
We will use an event-driven architecture based on Apache Kafka as the central event bus. Microservices and CDC connectors will publish and subscribe to Kafka topics for domain events.

== Consequences
Positive:
* Loose coupling between producers and consumers.
* Scalability for high-throughput event processing.
* Supports replay and audit of events.

Negative:
* Operational overhead of Kafka clusters.
* Complexity in managing schema evolution.

Neutral:
* Encourages asynchronous design patterns.
