= ADR-007: TLS & AES Encryption with Audit Logging

== Context
All data in transit and at rest involves personal and financial customer data, subject to GDPR and BaFin requirements. Traceability of data operations is mandatory.

== Decision
We will enforce TLS 1.2+ for all network communication and AES-256 encryption for all data at rest. An audit logging service will capture every create, update, and delete operation on PII, including user, timestamp, and record ID.

== Consequences
Positive:
* Meets encryption and audit requirements for compliance.
* Demonstrable traceability for audits.

Negative:
* Performance overhead for encryption and logging.
* Additional storage for audit logs.

Neutral:
* Increases operational and security testing efforts.
