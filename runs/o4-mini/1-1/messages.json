This manual process is time-consuming, prone to errors (e.g., double bookings), and offers no flexibility for customers who want to book outside of business hours. \\nThe owner wants to modernize operations, improve customer experience, and reduce the administrative workload on the staff. \\nThe application should be straightforward and require minimal technical knowledge to operate.\\n\\n## Key Stakeholders\\n\\n- **Barbershop Owner**: Primary user of the admin interface. Needs to manage schedules, services, and view booking reports.\\n- **Barbers**: Will use the system to check their daily schedules.\\n- **Customers**: Will use the public-facing website to book, reschedule, or cancel their appointments.\\n- **Receptionist**: Will use the system to manage walk-in appointments and assist customers over the phone.\\n\\n## User Stories\\n\\n### Customer Stories\\n\\n- As a customer, I want to see available time slots for a specific service and barber, so that I can book an appointment at my convenience.\\n- As a customer, I want to create a simple profile with my name and contact details, so I don't have to enter them every time I book.\\n- As a customer, I want to receive an email and SMS confirmation for my new appointment, so I am sure it has been booked correctly.\\n- As a customer, I want to receive a reminder 24 hours before my appointment, so I don't forget it.\\n- As a customer, I want to be able to easily cancel or reschedule my appointment online up to 24 hours in advance.\\n- As a customer, I want to view my history of past and upcoming appointments.\\n\\n### Staff (Owner/Receptionist/Barber) Stories\\n\\n- As the barbershop owner, I want to define the services offered, including their name, duration, and price.\\n- As the barbershop owner, I want to manage my staff's profiles and their standard working hours and days off, so the system only shows real availability.\\n- As the barbershop owner, I want to view a daily, weekly, and monthly overview of all booked appointments for all barbers.\\n- As a barber, I want to be able to block specific time slots in my calendar for breaks or personal appointments.\\n- As a receptionist, I want to be able to book an appointment on behalf of a customer who calls or walks in.\\n- As the owner, I want to see a simple report on which services are most frequently booked, so I can understand my business better.\\n- As a barber, I want to see any notes a customer has left with their booking (e.g., \\\"allergic to a certain product\\\").\\n\\n## Quality Attributes\\n\\n- **Usability**: The system must be extremely easy to use for both customers and staff with no technical background. The booking process should be completable in just a few clicks.\\n- **Reliability**: The system must be available 24/7. The booking data must be accurate to avoid conflicts like double bookings.\\n- **Performance**: The page for viewing available slots should load within 2 seconds, even during peak hours.\\n- **Security**: Customer data (name, email, phone number) must be stored securely. No payment information will be handled initially.\\n\\n## Additional Information Important for the Project\\n\\n- The initial version will not handle payments. This is a potential feature for a future release.\\n- The application must be responsive and work flawlessly on mobile devices, as most customers are expected to book via their smartphones.\\n- The architecture will be a classic two-tier application: a single-page application (SPA) frontend (e.g., using React or Vue.js) and a monolithic backend (e.g., using Node.js/Express, Python/Django) with a single relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL).\\n\"}",

            "content": "Below is a consolidated list of Architecturally-Significant Requirements (ASRs) extracted from the “Prime-Cuts Booking” project description. These ASRs capture the functional, quality and constraint aspects that will drive the high-level architecture design.\n\n1. Functional ASRs  \n   • FR-ASR-01: Appointment CRUD with Conflict Prevention  \n     – Description: Customers, receptionists or barbers must be able to create, read, update or cancel an appointment. The system must enforce transactional integrity so that no two appointments overlap for the same barber.  \n     – Rationale: Prevents double-bookings; core to system correctness.  \n     – Stakeholders: Customers, Receptionist, Barbers, Owner.  \n     – Acceptance Criteria: Under concurrent booking attempts for the same slot, only one succeeds and all others receive an immediate “slot unavailable” response.\n\n   • FR-ASR-02: Real-Time Availability Query  \n     – Description: Public‐facing UI must retrieve and display available time slots for a given barber and service in under 2 seconds, even at peak load.  \n     – Rationale: Drives both performance and user satisfaction.  \n     – Stakeholders: Customers.  \n     – Acceptance Criteria: 95th-percentile response time ≤2s with simulated peak traffic.\n\n   • FR-ASR-03: Flexible Staff Calendar Management  \n     – Description: The owner and barbers must define standard working hours, days off and ad-hoc blocked slots (breaks, personal appointments). The system must merge these rules to compute true availability.  \n     – Rationale: Accurate availability drives the booking engine.  \n     – Stakeholders: Barbers, Owner.  \n     – Acceptance Criteria: Blocked slots appear instantly in the availability view and cannot be booked.\n\n   • FR-ASR-04: Profile & History Management  \n     – Description: Customers can create and maintain a profile (name, contact); the system retains past and upcoming appointment history. Staff profiles (roles, contact) are also manageable by the owner.  \n     – Rationale: Streamlines booking and supports personalized service.  \n     – Stakeholders: Customers, Owner.  \n     – Acceptance Criteria: Profile creation/edit operations succeed in <1s; history listing paginates correctly.\n\n   • FR-ASR-05: Notification Service Integration  \n     – Description: Upon booking, rescheduling or cancellation, the system must send email and SMS confirmations immediately and reminders 24 hours before the appointment. Integration must accommodate pluggable providers.  \n     – Rationale: Improves customer experience and reduces no-shows.  \n     – Stakeholders: Customers.  \n     – Acceptance Criteria: Confirmation delivered within 30s of booking; reminder sent exactly 24h before appointment time.\n\n   • FR-ASR-06: Reporting & Analytics  \n     – Description: The owner must obtain daily/weekly/monthly overviews of appointments and a summary of most-frequently booked services.  \n     – Rationale: Supports business insights and decision-making.  \n     – Stakeholders: Owner.  \n     – Acceptance Criteria: Reports generate in <5s for up to 6 months of data.\n\n2. Quality-Attribute ASRs  \n   • QA-ASR-01: Availability & Reliability  \n     – Requirement: System uptime ≥99.9% (24×7 access). Backend must use a robust persistence strategy (ACID transactions, automated backups).  \n     – Rationale: Barbershop operates around the clock; double-booking or lost data is unacceptable.  \n\n   • QA-ASR-02: Performance & Scalability  \n     – Requirement: API endpoints serving availability and booking operations must respond in ≤2s under expected peak load. Design for horizontal scale of stateless services if load grows.  \n     – Rationale: Maintains user satisfaction and prevents timeouts during spikes.  \n\n   • QA-ASR-03: Security & Privacy  \n     – Requirement: All customer and staff personal data must be encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest. Implement role-based access control (RBAC) so only authorized users manage sensitive operations. Comply with applicable data-protection regulations (e.g., GDPR).  \n     – Rationale: Protects PII and builds trust.  \n\n   • QA-ASR-04: Usability & Responsiveness  \n     – Requirement: The UI must be an SPA with a mobile-first responsive design. Booking flows (slot selection → confirmation) shall not exceed three distinct user interactions/clicks.  \n     – Rationale: Low technical barrier for staff and customers; most bookings via smartphones.  \n\n   • QA-ASR-05: Maintainability & Extensibility  \n     – Requirement: The codebase must follow a layered, modular design (Presentation → API → Business Logic → Data Access) with clear separation of concerns. The architecture must accommodate future features (e.g., payment processing) with minimal changes.  \n     – Rationale: Ensures rapid iteration and lowers long-term maintenance costs.  \n\n3. Architectural Constraints  \n   • C-ASR-01: Two-Tier Monolith  \n     – SPA frontend (e.g. React or Vue.js)  \n     – Backend monolith (Node.js/Express or Python/Django) + PostgreSQL  \n   • C-ASR-02: No In-App Payment in V1  \n   • C-ASR-03: Third-Party Email/SMS Provider Integration  \n\nThese ASRs will guide the high-level module decomposition, technology selection, data-model design, and non-functional patterns (caching, concurrency control, load balancing, etc.).",

It satisfies the two-tier monolith constraint, meets all ASRs, and lays out the major modules, their responsibilities, interactions, and technology choices.\n\n1. Overall Deployment View  \n   • Clients (Browser/Mobile)  \n     – React (or Vue.js) Single-Page Application—mobile-first, responsive  \n     – Communicates over HTTPS/TLS with backend REST/JSON-over-HTTP APIs  \n     – Hosted as static assets on a CDN (e.g. AWS S3 + CloudFront) for low latency  \n\n   • Load Balancer / API Gateway  \n     – Terminates TLS, enforces rate-limits, CORS policies  \n     – Routes requests to a pool of identical application instances  \n\n   • Application Tier (Monolith)  \n     – Node.js + Express (or Python + Django) monolithic service  \n     – Stateless REST API servers, horizontally scalable by adding instances  \n     – Background workers (same codebase) for async jobs (notifications, reporting)  \n     – Local in-process message queue (e.g. Bull or Celery) or external (Redis) for job dispatch  \n\n   • Data Tier  \n     – PostgreSQL relational database (ACID, schemas for bookings, users, services, staff)  \n     – Redis cache for:  \n       • Availability query caching (slot lookup)  \n       • Session store (if server-side sessions used)  \n       • Rate-limiting, distributed locks for booking conflict prevention  \n\n   • Third-Party Services  \n     – Email provider (e.g. SendGrid, SES)  \n     – SMS provider (e.g. Twilio)  \n     – Monitoring & Logging (Prometheus + Grafana, ELK stack)  \n\n2. Key Modules & Layers (Layered + Modular Monolith)  \n   A. Presentation Layer  \n      • SPA UI (React/Vue)  \n      • Component library for booking widget, calendar views, forms  \n\n   B. API Layer  \n      • REST controllers/endpoints grouped by bounded context:  \n         – /auth – registration, login, JWT token exchange (OAuth2/password flow)  \n         – /customers – profile CRUD, history lookup  \n         – /staff – staff profiles, working hours, blocks  \n         – /services – service catalog CRUD  \n         – /bookings – slot search, create/update/delete, conflict checks  \n         – /reports – summary endpoints  \n      • Request validation, RBAC enforcement (owner vs. barber vs. receptionist vs. customer)  \n\n   C. Business Logic Layer  \n      • Booking Engine  \n         – Merges staff schedules + ad-hoc blocks → availability grid  \n         – Uses distributed lock (Redis) + ACID transaction on bookings table to prevent overlaps  \n      • Notification Manager  \n         – Publishes “booking.created”, “booking.rescheduled”, “booking.canceled” events to job queue  \n         – Schedules reminder jobs at booking-time + 24h offset  \n      • Reporting Service  \n         – Aggregates bookings by service/staff/time window  \n         – Background‐generated caches or on-the-fly SQL with proper indexing  \n      • Profile & History Service  \n      • Staff Management Service  \n\n   D. Data Access Layer  \n      • Repository/DAO pattern for each aggregate (UserRepo, BookingRepo, ServiceRepo, StaffRepo)  \n      • Unit of Work for transactional consistency  \n\n3. Cross-Cutting Concerns & Patterns  \n   • Security  \n     – All traffic over TLS; JWT tokens for API; RBAC checks in middleware  \n     – PII at rest encrypted (Postgres TDE or column-level encryption)  \n     – GDPR-compliant data purge workflows  \n   • Performance & Caching  \n     – Redis cache for availability queries; cache invalidation on schedule/booking changes  \n     – CDN for static SPA assets  \n     – Database indexing on (barber_id, timeslot), on customer_id for history queries  \n   • Reliability & Scalability  \n     – Horizontal scaling of stateless API servers behind LB  \n     – Monitored health checks; auto-restart on failure; containerized deployment (Docker + Kubernetes or ECS)  \n     – Automated nightly backups of Postgres; multi-AZ database  \n   • Asynchrony & Resilience  \n     – Background worker pool for notifications and heavy reports  \n     – Retry logic with back-off for third-party calls; circuit breaker pattern  \n   • Observability  \n     – Centralized logging (request IDs), structured logs  \n     – Metrics (API latency, error rates, queue lengths) pushed to Prometheus/Grafana  \n     – Alerts on SLA breaches (e.g., P95 >2s, queue backlog > threshold)  \n   • Maintainability & Extensibility  \n     – Clear module boundaries; single code repo with sub-folders by domain context  \n     – Feature toggles for future payment integration  \n     – Well-documented API (OpenAPI/Swagger) and automated tests per module  \n\n4. Data Model Sketch (Key Entities)  \n   • Customer(id, name, email, phone, created_at, …)  \n   • Staff(id, name, role, working_hours, days_off, …)  \n   • Service(id, name, duration_minutes, price, …)  \n   • Booking(id, customer_id, staff_id, service_id, start_time, end_time, status, notes)  \n   • NotificationJob(id, booking_id, type, scheduled_time, status)  \n\n5. Sequence Flow (Booking a Slot)  \n   1. Customer → SPA → GET /bookings/availability?staff=&service=&date=  \n   2. API Layer checks Redis cache → miss → Business Layer computes availability → caches result → returns slots  \n   3. Customer selects slot + confirms → POST /bookings  \n   4. API Middleware applies distributed lock on (staff_id, timeslot) → begins DB transaction  \n   5. BookingEngine validates no overlap → writes Booking record → commits  \n   6. Unlock; enqueues notification job to Redis queue  \n   7. Worker picks job → calls Email/SMS provider → updates NotificationJob status  \n   8. SPA updates UI, shows confirmation  \n\nThis architecture meets all ASRs:  \n- Usability: SPA, mobile-first, <3 clicks  \n- Reliability: ACID bookings, distributed locks, backups, ≥99.9% uptime  \n- Performance: caching, CDN, horizontal scale, P95 ≤2s  \n- Security: TLS, RBAC, encryption, GDPR readiness  \n- Maintainability: layered, modular, clear separation, ready for future payments  \n\nNext Steps  \n• Validate the high-level design.  \n• Drill into one module (e.g., Booking Engine): define detailed data structures, APIs, error flows.",

Booking Engine Responsibilities  \n   1.1. Compute True Availability  \n     – Merge staff standard working hours, days off, ad-hoc blocked slots, existing appointments  \n     – Produce a list of open time slots for a given staff member and service duration  \n     – Cache the result for short TTL to meet FR-ASR-02 (≤2s response)  \n   1.2. Manage Appointment Lifecycle (CRUD)  \n     – Create/update/delete appointments transactionally  \n     – Enforce no-overlap per barber (conflict prevention)  \n     – Trigger downstream notifications and cache invalidation  \n   1.3. Concurrency Control  \n     – Use distributed locks (per barber + time window) to serialize concurrent booking attempts  \n     – Fall back to DB-level serializable transactions if lock acquisition fails  \n\n2. Sub-Components & Their Interfaces  \n\n   2.1. AvailabilityModule  \n     • Responsibilities  \n       – loadStaffSchedule(staffId, dateRange): StaffSchedule  \n       – loadBlockedSlots(staffId, dateRange): List<TimeRange>  \n       – loadExistingAppointments(staffId, dateRange): List<TimeRange>  \n       – computeAvailableSlots(schedule, blocks, appts, serviceDuration): List<TimeRange>  \n     • Key Interfaces  \n       – IStaffScheduleRepository { getWorkingHours(staffId, dateRange) }  \n       – IBlockRepository { getBlockedSlots(staffId, dateRange) }  \n       – IBookingRepository { getAppointments(staffId, dateRange) }  \n       – ICache { get(key), set(key, value, ttl) }  \n\n   2.2. BookingModule  \n     • Responsibilities  \n       – bookSlot(request): BookingConfirmation  \n       – rescheduleBooking(request): BookingConfirmation  \n       – cancelBooking(bookingId): CancellationConfirmation  \n     • Key Interfaces  \n       – IBookingRepository { create(Booking), update(Booking), delete(id) }  \n       – ILockManager { acquireLock(key, timeout), releaseLock(key) }  \n       – IDatabaseTransaction { begin(), commit(), rollback() }  \n       – IEventPublisher { publish(event) }  \n\n   2.3. ConflictResolver  \n     • Responsibilities  \n       – validateNoOverlap(staffId, candidateRange)  \n     • Key Interfaces  \n       – IBookingRepository { existsOverlap(staffId, timeRange) }  \n\n   2.4. LockManager (Redis-backed)  \n     • Responsibilities  \n       – provide distributed mutual exclusion on “staff:{id}:timeslot:{range}”  \n     • Implementation Details  \n       – Uses Redlock algorithm on Redis cluster  \n       – Fails fast if lock can’t be acquired in 50 ms → return “slot busy”  \n\n3. Data Flow & Sequence for Booking a Slot  \n\n   1. Client → GET /availability?staffId=&date= → AvailabilityController  \n   2. Controller calls AvailabilityModule.computeAvailableSlots(…)  \n      – Look up in Redis cache: if present and fresh (<30 s), return cached list  \n      – Otherwise:  \n         a) load schedule + blocks + appointments from their repos  \n         b) compute slots → cache result with 30 s TTL → return to client  \n   3. Client chooses slot → POST /bookings with {customerId, staffId, serviceId, startTime}  \n   4. BookingController → BookingModule.bookSlot(request)  \n      a) LockManager.acquireLock(\"staff:{id}:timeslot:{start-end}\", timeout=50 ms)  \n      b) Transaction.begin()  \n      c) ConflictResolver.validateNoOverlap(...)  \n         – if overlap: rollback + release lock + return “slot unavailable”  \n      d) IBookingRepository.create(BookingEntity)  \n      e) Transaction.commit()  \n      f) LockManager.releaseLock(...)  \n      g) EventPublisher.publish(BookingCreatedEvent)  \n   5. HTTP 201 → client; background worker picks event → sends email/SMS  \n\n4. Key Patterns & Technologies  \n\n   • Repository + Unit of Work Pattern  \n     – Isolate data-access logic; group operations in a single DB transaction  \n   • Redlock (Redis-based Distributed Lock)  \n     – Ensures only one booking writer per staff+timeslot window  \n   • In-Memory/Redis Caching  \n     – Short-TTL cache of availability per staff+date to hit ≤2 s ASR  \n   • Circuit Breaker & Retry  \n     – For Redis or DB unavailability, degrade gracefully: “service unavailable” with 503  \n   • Metrics & Tracing  \n     – Instrument each step (cache hit/miss, lock wait time, DB latency) for observability and SLA alerts  \n   • RBAC Enforcement in Controllers  \n     – Ensure only permitted roles (customer, receptionist, barber, owner) invoke each operation  \n\n5. Component Diagram (excerpt)  \n\n   [AvailabilityController] → [AvailabilityModule] → {StaffRepo, BlockRepo, BookingRepo, Cache}  \n   [BookingController] → [BookingModule] → {LockManager, ConflictResolver, BookingRepo, Transaction, EventPublisher}  \n\n6. Error Handling & Reliability  \n\n   • Lock acquisition timeout → return 409 Conflict (“slot busy”)  \n   • DB transaction error → rollback + return 500 with safe message  \n   • Cache unavailability → log warning + proceed with direct compute (slower)  \n   • Event publish failures → retry with back-off; dead-letter queue for manual inspection  \n\n---\n\nThe Booking Engine design above ensures:  \n  – No double-bookings (FR-ASR-01) via strong locking + transactional checks  \n  – Real-time slot queries under 2 s (FR-ASR-02) using Redis caching  \n  – Full support for working‐hours, blocks and days‐off (FR-ASR-03) in schedule merge  \n  – ACID and ≥99.9% uptime (QA-ASR-01) through robust DB transactions, backups, multi-AZ DB  \n  – Horizontal scalability (QA-ASR-02) by keeping the module stateless (locks + cache external)  \n  – Secure operations (QA-ASR-03) with RBAC, TLS, and encrypted data stores  \n\nThis Booking Engine is now ready for review and integration into the monolithic backend.",

            "content": "Architecture Review: Booking Engine Detailed Design\n\nAfter careful analysis, I find the proposed Booking Engine design to be solid and well aligned with the ASRs. Core functionality, conflict prevention, performance optimizations, and reliability concerns have been addressed. However, a few gaps and clarifications remain. I recommend **changes required** before approval.\n\n1. Caching & Invalidation  \n  • Short-TTL cache (30 s) for availability meets latency targets, but risk of stale slots remains when bookings or ad-hoc blocks occur.  \n  • Change required:  \n    – Implement proactive cache invalidation on any booking create/update/cancel or block change for the affected staff+date key instead of waiting for expiry.  \n    – Include a cache version or ETag per staff+day to simplify invalidation logic.\n\n2. Locking & Time Windows  \n  • Redis Redlock is appropriate, but lock granularity (“staff:{id}:timeslot:{range}”) may lead to many keys if ranges vary.  \n  • Change required:  \n    – Standardize on fixed time-slice locks (e.g. 15-minute buckets) or use a single “staff:{id}:date” lock per day to serialize all bookings for that barber on that date.  \n    – Ensure lock TTL is configured safely (greater than worst-case DB transaction time plus retries).\n\n3. Time-Zone & DST Handling  \n  • The design glosses over time-zone management. All date/time calculations (working hours, blocks, appointments, reminders) must be normalized (e.g. stored in UTC) and converted for presentation.  \n  • Change required:  \n    – Explicitly state that all times are stored in UTC; client and business logic layers handle locale conversion.  \n    – Validate edge cases around daylight-savings transitions in AvailabilityModule.\n\n4. Indexing & Query Performance  \n  • To guarantee sub-2 s availability lookups and conflict checks, we need explicit DB indexes.  \n  • Change required:  \n    – Define composite indexes on bookings (staff_id, start_time, end_time) and on blocks (staff_id, start, end).  \n    – Consider a date-partitioned table or partial indexes if data volume grows.\n\n5. Error Handling & Back-pressure  \n  • The fallback path when Redis or the lock manager is unavailable is “degrade gracefully,” but specifics are missing.  \n  • Change required:  \n    – Define behavior when cache is down (e.g. still compute availability but log a metric).  \n    – If Redis lock service is down, fall back to serializable DB transactions with “SELECT … FOR UPDATE” on a per-staff calendar row.\n\n6. Testing & Observability  \n  • Tests for race conditions (concurrent booking attempts) should be explicitly mentioned.  \n  • Change required:  \n    – Add end-to-end concurrency tests simulating N simultaneous booking requests for the same slot.  \n    – Instrument and alert on lock‐wait times exceeding a threshold to detect congestion.\n\n7. Sequence Diagram Clarity  \n  • The sequence flow is clear, but “CandidateRange” in ConflictResolver is vague.  \n  • Change required:  \n    – Rename to “requestedSlot” and ensure the ConflictResolver logs rejected time spans for audit.\n\nSummary  \nAll ASRs remain addressed—transactional integrity, sub-2 s slot lookup, schedule merging, high availability, horizontal scalability, and security. The above changes are required to harden the solution against stale cache, lock contention, time-zone bugs, and growth in data volume. Once applied, I will **approve** the Booking Engine design.",

            "content": "Below is the **revised** Booking Engine design incorporating the Review Agent’s required changes.\n\n---\n\n1. Revised Responsibilities & Flows\n\n1.1 Proactive Cache Invalidation  \n  • On **any** appointment create/update/cancel or ad-hoc block change for `staffId` on `date` → invoke  \n    – CacheService.invalidate(“availability:{staffId}:{date}:{version}”)  \n    – Internally bump a **per-staff+date version** (stored in Redis or small “Version” table) so stale keys never match.  \n  • Key format: `availability:{staffId}:{date}:{version}`  \n\n1.2 Lock Granularity  \n  • Use a **single per-staff+date** lock key:  \n    – `lock:staff:{staffId}:date:{YYYYMMDD}`  \n    – TTL = e.g. 5s (longer than worst-case transaction + retry)  \n  • BookingController.bookSlot():  \n    – Try `acquireLock(lockKey, timeout=50ms)`  \n    – If fail → return HTTP 409 “slot busy”  \n    – Else → proceed + releaseLock(lockKey)  \n\n1.3 Time-Zone & DST  \n  • **All** timestamps stored in UTC in PostgreSQL.  \n  • Business-logic modules operate in UTC.  \n  • SPA UI converts UTC → user locale (incl. DST) for display.  \n  • AvailabilityModule tests include DST transitions (e.g., spring-forward gap / fall-back overlap).  \n\n---\n\n2. Updated Sub-Components & Interfaces\n\n2.1 AvailabilityModule  \n  – computeAvailableSlots(staffId, date, serviceDuration): List<TimeRangeUTC>  \n    *Fetch version:* `ver = VersionRepo.getVersion(staffId, date)`  \n    *Fetch from cache:* `Cache.get(\"availability:{staffId}:{date}:{ver}\")`  \n    *On miss:*  \n      • load schedule, blocks, existing appts (all in UTC)  \n      • merge & slice into slots  \n      • Cache.set(key, slots, ttl=30s)  \n\n2.2 BookingModule  \n  – bookSlot(requestedSlotUTC): BookingConfirmation  \n      1. lockKey = “lock:staff:{id}:date:{YYYYMMDD(requestedSlotUTC)}”  \n      2. LockManager.acquire(lockKey) or 409  \n      3. Transaction.begin()  \n      4. if BookingRepo.existsOverlap(staffId, requestedSlotUTC):  \n           • log.error(“Rejected slot”, staffId, requestedSlotUTC)  \n           • rollback + releaseLock + return 409  \n      5. BookingRepo.create(BookingEntity UTC)  \n      6. Transaction.commit()  \n      7. releaseLock(lockKey)  \n      8. VersionRepo.bumpVersion(staffId, date) → triggers cache invalidation  \n      9. EventPublisher.publish(BookingCreatedEvent)  \n\n2.3 Fallback Strategies  \n  • **Cache unavailable** → log.warn + compute slots on-the-fly (slower)  \n  • **Lock service down** → fallback to **DB row-lock**:  \n      – `SELECT 1 FROM StaffCalendar WHERE staff_id = ? AND date = ? FOR UPDATE`  \n      – Then proceed with overlap check + insert in same transaction  \n\n---\n\n3. DB Indexes & Partitioning\n\n  • ON bookings(staff_id, start_time, end_time)  \n     – `CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_staff_time ON bookings(staff_id, start_time, end_time);`  \n  • ON blocks(staff_id, start_time, end_time)  \n     – `CREATE INDEX idx_blocks_staff_time ON blocks(staff_id, start_time, end_time);`  \n  • Consider **daily partition** on bookings by `date(start_time)` if volume grows >100k records/day.  \n\n---\n\n4. Testing & Observability\n\n4.1 End-to-End Concurrency Tests  \n  • Simulate N concurrent `POST /bookings` for same `staff+requestedSlotUTC`  \n  • Assert exactly one succeeds; others get 409.  \n\n4.2 Metrics & Alerts  \n  • Instrument:  \n     – Lock wait time per booking request (histogram)  \n     – Cache hit/miss ratio for availability  \n     – DB response times for overlap check  \n  • Alert if  \n     – P95 lock-wait >100ms  \n     – Cache miss rate >20%  \n     – Booking operation error rate >1%  \n\n---\n\n5. Final Component Diagram (excerpt)\n\n [AvailabilityController]  \n     → AvailabilityModule  \n        → {StaffScheduleRepo, BlockRepo, BookingRepo, VersionRepo, Cache}  \n\n [BookingController]  \n     → BookingModule  \n        → {LockManager, BookingRepo, VersionRepo, Transaction, EventPublisher}  \n\n---\n\nWith these updates we have:\n\n• No stale availability (proactive invalidation + versioned keys)  \n• Simplified, robust locking (per-day lock)  \n• Correct UTC-based times + DST handling  \n• Explicit DB indexing & growth strategy  \n• Clear fallback paths for cache/lock failures  \n• Thorough concurrency tests & observability  \n\nThe revised Booking Engine design now fully addresses all ASRs and review feedback. It is ready for final review.",

            "content": "Review of Revised Booking Engine Design\n\nThe updated design convincingly addresses the earlier concerns around cache consistency, lock granularity, time-zone handling, indexing, fallbacks, testing, and observability. Core ASRs remain fully satisfied. I recommend **approval pending two clarifications**:\n\n1. Clarify Fallback DB Lock Table  \n   • The fallback path on lock-service failure uses a row‐lock (`SELECT … FOR UPDATE`). The design references a `StaffCalendar` table which isn’t defined elsewhere.  \n   • Suggested resolution:  \n     – Define a lightweight `StaffCalendarDate(staff_id, date)` table that is inserted/maintained when a staff member is scheduled. Use `FOR UPDATE` on that table’s row.  \n     – Or, use a synthetic “calendar” row in a dedicated locking table:  \n         CREATE TABLE staff_calendar_lock (staff_id INT, date DATE, PRIMARY KEY(staff_id, date));  \n\n2. Lock Granularity Trade-off Acknowledgment  \n   • Using one lock per staff+date ensures correctness with minimal key churn, but serializes all same-day bookings (even non‐overlapping slots). For a high‐traffic scenario this could become a bottleneck.  \n   • Suggested resolution:  \n     – Acknowledge this trade-off in the design doc and note that if high concurrency arises, the system can switch to finer‐grained locks (e.g. per 15-minute slot) without major refactoring.  \n     – Ensure the lock-TTL (e.g. 5s) comfortably exceeds worst-case transaction time but remains low enough to avoid long stalls.\n\nOnce these two points are clarified/added, I approve the Booking Engine design as meeting all requirements, ready for implementation.",

Fallback DB Lock Table  \n   • **Table Definition**  \n     ```sql\n     CREATE TABLE staff_calendar_lock (\n       staff_id   INT      NOT NULL,\n       date       DATE     NOT NULL,\n       PRIMARY KEY (staff_id, date)\n     );\n     ```  \n   • **Maintenance**  \n     – A row is pre-created for each staff member on any date they have standard working hours.  \n     – Alternatively, insert-on-demand when first booking/block operation occurs.  \n   • **Fallback Lock Usage**  \n     In the event Redis lock service is unreachable, the BookingModule.bookSlot flow becomes:  \n     ```\n     1. BEGIN TRANSACTION\n     2. SELECT * \n          FROM staff_calendar_lock \n          WHERE staff_id = :staffId \n            AND date     = :YYYYMMDD(requestedSlotUTC)\n          FOR UPDATE\n     3. // now the row is locked in this transaction\n     4. ConflictResolver.validateNoOverlap(...)\n     5. BookingRepo.create(...)\n     6. COMMIT\n     ```  \n     This guarantees mutual exclusion at the staff+date level without Redis.\n\n2. Lock Granularity Trade-Off  \n   • **Current Choice**: one lock per `staff_id + date`  \n     – Pros: minimal Redis key explosion, simple fallback to DB row-lock.  \n     – Cons: all booking attempts for that barber on that date—even non-overlapping—are serialized, potentially increasing latency under high concurrency.  \n   • **Mitigation & Future Refinement**  \n     – Monitor lock-wait metrics (P95) and booking throughput.  \n     – If contention becomes a bottleneck, migrate to finer-grained locks—e.g., one Redis or DB lock per 15-minute slot key:  \n       `lock:staff:{id}:slot:{YYYYMMDDHHMM}-{YYYYMMDDHHMM}`  \n     – This change is localized to the LockManager implementation without impacting conflict checks or transaction logic.\n\nWith these additions, the Booking Engine design is now complete and ready for final approval.",
