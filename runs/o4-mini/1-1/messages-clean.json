This manual process is time-consuming, prone to errors (e.g., double bookings), and offers no flexibility for customers who want to book outside of business hours. \\nThe owner wants to modernize operations, improve customer experience, and reduce the administrative workload on the staff. \\nThe application should be straightforward and require minimal technical knowledge to operate.\\n\\n## Key Stakeholders\\n\\n- **Barbershop Owner**: Primary user of the admin interface. Needs to manage schedules, services, and view booking reports.\\n- **Barbers**: Will use the system to check their daily schedules.\\n- **Customers**: Will use the public-facing website to book, reschedule, or cancel their appointments.\\n- **Receptionist**: Will use the system to manage walk-in appointments and assist customers over the phone.\\n\\n## User Stories\\n\\n### Customer Stories\\n\\n- As a customer, I want to see available time slots for a specific service and barber, so that I can book an appointment at my convenience.\\n- As a customer, I want to create a simple profile with my name and contact details, so I don't have to enter them every time I book.\\n- As a customer, I want to receive an email and SMS confirmation for my new appointment, so I am sure it has been booked correctly.\\n- As a customer, I want to receive a reminder 24 hours before my appointment, so I don't forget it.\\n- As a customer, I want to be able to easily cancel or reschedule my appointment online up to 24 hours in advance.\\n- As a customer, I want to view my history of past and upcoming appointments.\\n\\n### Staff (Owner/Receptionist/Barber) Stories\\n\\n- As the barbershop owner, I want to define the services offered, including their name, duration, and price.\\n- As the barbershop owner, I want to manage my staff's profiles and their standard working hours and days off, so the system only shows real availability.\\n- As the barbershop owner, I want to view a daily, weekly, and monthly overview of all booked appointments for all barbers.\\n- As a barber, I want to be able to block specific time slots in my calendar for breaks or personal appointments.\\n- As a receptionist, I want to be able to book an appointment on behalf of a customer who calls or walks in.\\n- As the owner, I want to see a simple report on which services are most frequently booked, so I can understand my business better.\\n- As a barber, I want to see any notes a customer has left with their booking (e.g., \\\"allergic to a certain product\\\").\\n\\n## Quality Attributes\\n\\n- **Usability**: The system must be extremely easy to use for both customers and staff with no technical background. The booking process should be completable in just a few clicks.\\n- **Reliability**: The system must be available 24/7. The booking data must be accurate to avoid conflicts like double bookings.\\n- **Performance**: The page for viewing available slots should load within 2 seconds, even during peak hours.\\n- **Security**: Customer data (name, email, phone number) must be stored securely. No payment information will be handled initially.\\n\\n## Additional Information Important for the Project\\n\\n- The initial version will not handle payments. This is a potential feature for a future release.\\n- The application must be responsive and work flawlessly on mobile devices, as most customers are expected to book via their smartphones.\\n- The architecture will be a classic two-tier application: a single-page application (SPA) frontend (e.g., using React or Vue.js) and a monolithic backend (e.g., using Node.js/Express, Python/Django) with a single relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL).\\n\"}",

            "content": "Below is a consolidated list of Architecturally-Significant Requirements (ASRs) extracted from the \u201cPrime-Cuts Booking\u201d project description. These ASRs capture the functional, quality and constraint aspects that will drive the high-level architecture design.\n\n1. Functional ASRs  \n   \u2022 FR-ASR-01: Appointment CRUD with Conflict Prevention  \n     \u2013 Description: Customers, receptionists or barbers must be able to create, read, update or cancel an appointment. The system must enforce transactional integrity so that no two appointments overlap for the same barber.  \n     \u2013 Rationale: Prevents double-bookings; core to system correctness.  \n     \u2013 Stakeholders: Customers, Receptionist, Barbers, Owner.  \n     \u2013 Acceptance Criteria: Under concurrent booking attempts for the same slot, only one succeeds and all others receive an immediate \u201cslot unavailable\u201d response.\n\n   \u2022 FR-ASR-02: Real-Time Availability Query  \n     \u2013 Description: Public\u2010facing UI must retrieve and display available time slots for a given barber and service in under 2 seconds, even at peak load.  \n     \u2013 Rationale: Drives both performance and user satisfaction.  \n     \u2013 Stakeholders: Customers.  \n     \u2013 Acceptance Criteria: 95th-percentile response time \u22642s with simulated peak traffic.\n\n   \u2022 FR-ASR-03: Flexible Staff Calendar Management  \n     \u2013 Description: The owner and barbers must define standard working hours, days off and ad-hoc blocked slots (breaks, personal appointments). The system must merge these rules to compute true availability.  \n     \u2013 Rationale: Accurate availability drives the booking engine.  \n     \u2013 Stakeholders: Barbers, Owner.  \n     \u2013 Acceptance Criteria: Blocked slots appear instantly in the availability view and cannot be booked.\n\n   \u2022 FR-ASR-04: Profile & History Management  \n     \u2013 Description: Customers can create and maintain a profile (name, contact); the system retains past and upcoming appointment history. Staff profiles (roles, contact) are also manageable by the owner.  \n     \u2013 Rationale: Streamlines booking and supports personalized service.  \n     \u2013 Stakeholders: Customers, Owner.  \n     \u2013 Acceptance Criteria: Profile creation/edit operations succeed in <1s; history listing paginates correctly.\n\n   \u2022 FR-ASR-05: Notification Service Integration  \n     \u2013 Description: Upon booking, rescheduling or cancellation, the system must send email and SMS confirmations immediately and reminders 24 hours before the appointment. Integration must accommodate pluggable providers.  \n     \u2013 Rationale: Improves customer experience and reduces no-shows.  \n     \u2013 Stakeholders: Customers.  \n     \u2013 Acceptance Criteria: Confirmation delivered within 30s of booking; reminder sent exactly 24h before appointment time.\n\n   \u2022 FR-ASR-06: Reporting & Analytics  \n     \u2013 Description: The owner must obtain daily/weekly/monthly overviews of appointments and a summary of most-frequently booked services.  \n     \u2013 Rationale: Supports business insights and decision-making.  \n     \u2013 Stakeholders: Owner.  \n     \u2013 Acceptance Criteria: Reports generate in <5s for up to 6 months of data.\n\n2. Quality-Attribute ASRs  \n   \u2022 QA-ASR-01: Availability & Reliability  \n     \u2013 Requirement: System uptime \u226599.9% (24\u00d77 access). Backend must use a robust persistence strategy (ACID transactions, automated backups).  \n     \u2013 Rationale: Barbershop operates around the clock; double-booking or lost data is unacceptable.  \n\n   \u2022 QA-ASR-02: Performance & Scalability  \n     \u2013 Requirement: API endpoints serving availability and booking operations must respond in \u22642s under expected peak load. Design for horizontal scale of stateless services if load grows.  \n     \u2013 Rationale: Maintains user satisfaction and prevents timeouts during spikes.  \n\n   \u2022 QA-ASR-03: Security & Privacy  \n     \u2013 Requirement: All customer and staff personal data must be encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest. Implement role-based access control (RBAC) so only authorized users manage sensitive operations. Comply with applicable data-protection regulations (e.g., GDPR).  \n     \u2013 Rationale: Protects PII and builds trust.  \n\n   \u2022 QA-ASR-04: Usability & Responsiveness  \n     \u2013 Requirement: The UI must be an SPA with a mobile-first responsive design. Booking flows (slot selection \u2192 confirmation) shall not exceed three distinct user interactions/clicks.  \n     \u2013 Rationale: Low technical barrier for staff and customers; most bookings via smartphones.  \n\n   \u2022 QA-ASR-05: Maintainability & Extensibility  \n     \u2013 Requirement: The codebase must follow a layered, modular design (Presentation \u2192 API \u2192 Business Logic \u2192 Data Access) with clear separation of concerns. The architecture must accommodate future features (e.g., payment processing) with minimal changes.  \n     \u2013 Rationale: Ensures rapid iteration and lowers long-term maintenance costs.  \n\n3. Architectural Constraints  \n   \u2022 C-ASR-01: Two-Tier Monolith  \n     \u2013 SPA frontend (e.g. React or Vue.js)  \n     \u2013 Backend monolith (Node.js/Express or Python/Django) + PostgreSQL  \n   \u2022 C-ASR-02: No In-App Payment in V1  \n   \u2022 C-ASR-03: Third-Party Email/SMS Provider Integration  \n\nThese ASRs will guide the high-level module decomposition, technology selection, data-model design, and non-functional patterns (caching, concurrency control, load balancing, etc.).",

            "content": "Architecture Review: Booking Engine Detailed Design\n\nAfter careful analysis, I find the proposed Booking Engine design to be solid and well aligned with the ASRs. Core functionality, conflict prevention, performance optimizations, and reliability concerns have been addressed. However, a few gaps and clarifications remain. I recommend **changes required** before approval.\n\n1. Caching & Invalidation  \n  \u2022 Short-TTL cache (30 s) for availability meets latency targets, but risk of stale slots remains when bookings or ad-hoc blocks occur.  \n  \u2022 Change required:  \n    \u2013 Implement proactive cache invalidation on any booking create/update/cancel or block change for the affected staff+date key instead of waiting for expiry.  \n    \u2013 Include a cache version or ETag per staff+day to simplify invalidation logic.\n\n2. Locking & Time Windows  \n  \u2022 Redis Redlock is appropriate, but lock granularity (\u201cstaff:{id}:timeslot:{range}\u201d) may lead to many keys if ranges vary.  \n  \u2022 Change required:  \n    \u2013 Standardize on fixed time-slice locks (e.g. 15-minute buckets) or use a single \u201cstaff:{id}:date\u201d lock per day to serialize all bookings for that barber on that date.  \n    \u2013 Ensure lock TTL is configured safely (greater than worst-case DB transaction time plus retries).\n\n3. Time-Zone & DST Handling  \n  \u2022 The design glosses over time-zone management. All date/time calculations (working hours, blocks, appointments, reminders) must be normalized (e.g. stored in UTC) and converted for presentation.  \n  \u2022 Change required:  \n    \u2013 Explicitly state that all times are stored in UTC; client and business logic layers handle locale conversion.  \n    \u2013 Validate edge cases around daylight-savings transitions in AvailabilityModule.\n\n4. Indexing & Query Performance  \n  \u2022 To guarantee sub-2 s availability lookups and conflict checks, we need explicit DB indexes.  \n  \u2022 Change required:  \n    \u2013 Define composite indexes on bookings (staff_id, start_time, end_time) and on blocks (staff_id, start, end).  \n    \u2013 Consider a date-partitioned table or partial indexes if data volume grows.\n\n5. Error Handling & Back-pressure  \n  \u2022 The fallback path when Redis or the lock manager is unavailable is \u201cdegrade gracefully,\u201d but specifics are missing.  \n  \u2022 Change required:  \n    \u2013 Define behavior when cache is down (e.g. still compute availability but log a metric).  \n    \u2013 If Redis lock service is down, fall back to serializable DB transactions with \u201cSELECT \u2026 FOR UPDATE\u201d on a per-staff calendar row.\n\n6. Testing & Observability  \n  \u2022 Tests for race conditions (concurrent booking attempts) should be explicitly mentioned.  \n  \u2022 Change required:  \n    \u2013 Add end-to-end concurrency tests simulating N simultaneous booking requests for the same slot.  \n    \u2013 Instrument and alert on lock\u2010wait times exceeding a threshold to detect congestion.\n\n7. Sequence Diagram Clarity  \n  \u2022 The sequence flow is clear, but \u201cCandidateRange\u201d in ConflictResolver is vague.  \n  \u2022 Change required:  \n    \u2013 Rename to \u201crequestedSlot\u201d and ensure the ConflictResolver logs rejected time spans for audit.\n\nSummary  \nAll ASRs remain addressed\u2014transactional integrity, sub-2 s slot lookup, schedule merging, high availability, horizontal scalability, and security. The above changes are required to harden the solution against stale cache, lock contention, time-zone bugs, and growth in data volume. Once applied, I will **approve** the Booking Engine design.",

            "content": "Review of Revised Booking Engine Design\n\nThe updated design convincingly addresses the earlier concerns around cache consistency, lock granularity, time-zone handling, indexing, fallbacks, testing, and observability. Core ASRs remain fully satisfied. I recommend **approval pending two clarifications**:\n\n1. Clarify Fallback DB Lock Table  \n   \u2022 The fallback path on lock-service failure uses a row\u2010lock (`SELECT \u2026 FOR UPDATE`). The design references a `StaffCalendar` table which isn\u2019t defined elsewhere.  \n   \u2022 Suggested resolution:  \n     \u2013 Define a lightweight `StaffCalendarDate(staff_id, date)` table that is inserted/maintained when a staff member is scheduled. Use `FOR UPDATE` on that table\u2019s row.  \n     \u2013 Or, use a synthetic \u201ccalendar\u201d row in a dedicated locking table:  \n         CREATE TABLE staff_calendar_lock (staff_id INT, date DATE, PRIMARY KEY(staff_id, date));  \n\n2. Lock Granularity Trade-off Acknowledgment  \n   \u2022 Using one lock per staff+date ensures correctness with minimal key churn, but serializes all same-day bookings (even non\u2010overlapping slots). For a high\u2010traffic scenario this could become a bottleneck.  \n   \u2022 Suggested resolution:  \n     \u2013 Acknowledge this trade-off in the design doc and note that if high concurrency arises, the system can switch to finer\u2010grained locks (e.g. per 15-minute slot) without major refactoring.  \n     \u2013 Ensure the lock-TTL (e.g. 5s) comfortably exceeds worst-case transaction time but remains low enough to avoid long stalls.\n\nOnce these two points are clarified/added, I approve the Booking Engine design as meeting all requirements, ready for implementation.",

Fallback DB Lock Table  \n   \u2022 **Table Definition**  \n     ```sql\n     CREATE TABLE staff_calendar_lock (\n       staff_id   INT      NOT NULL,\n       date       DATE     NOT NULL,\n       PRIMARY KEY (staff_id, date)\n     );\n     ```  \n   \u2022 **Maintenance**  \n     \u2013 A row is pre-created for each staff member on any date they have standard working hours.  \n     \u2013 Alternatively, insert-on-demand when first booking/block operation occurs.  \n   \u2022 **Fallback Lock Usage**  \n     In the event Redis lock service is unreachable, the BookingModule.bookSlot flow becomes:  \n     ```\n     1. BEGIN TRANSACTION\n     2. SELECT * \n          FROM staff_calendar_lock \n          WHERE staff_id = :staffId \n            AND date     = :YYYYMMDD(requestedSlotUTC)\n          FOR UPDATE\n     3. // now the row is locked in this transaction\n     4. ConflictResolver.validateNoOverlap(...)\n     5. BookingRepo.create(...)\n     6. COMMIT\n     ```  \n     This guarantees mutual exclusion at the staff+date level without Redis.\n\n2. Lock Granularity Trade-Off  \n   \u2022 **Current Choice**: one lock per `staff_id + date`  \n     \u2013 Pros: minimal Redis key explosion, simple fallback to DB row-lock.  \n     \u2013 Cons: all booking attempts for that barber on that date\u2014even non-overlapping\u2014are serialized, potentially increasing latency under high concurrency.  \n   \u2022 **Mitigation & Future Refinement**  \n     \u2013 Monitor lock-wait metrics (P95) and booking throughput.  \n     \u2013 If contention becomes a bottleneck, migrate to finer-grained locks\u2014e.g., one Redis or DB lock per 15-minute slot key:  \n       `lock:staff:{id}:slot:{YYYYMMDDHHMM}-{YYYYMMDDHHMM}`  \n     \u2013 This change is localized to the LockManager implementation without impacting conflict checks or transaction logic.\n\nWith these additions, the Booking Engine design is now complete and ready for final approval.",
