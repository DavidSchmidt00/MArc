= ADR-0001: Two-Tier Monolithic Architecture
Date: 2024-06-10

== Context
Prime-Cuts Booking must be delivered rapidly for a small barbershop with limited devops. The system must be easy to deploy and operate, while satisfying requirements for performance, reliability, and maintainability. Stakeholders include non-technical barbershop staff and a small development team.

== Decision
We will adopt a two-tier monolithic architecture comprising:
* A front-end Single-Page Application (SPA) using React or Vue.js, delivered via CDN.
* A backend monolithic service built in Node.js/Express (or Python/Django) exposing RESTful endpoints and containing all business logic.

This monolith will handle UI serving, API requests, business workflows, persistence, and background jobs within a single deployable unit (packaged as a Docker container).

== Consequences
* Positive:
  * Simplified deployment and operational overheadâ€”one artifact to build, deploy, and monitor.
  * Easier to develop and test end-to-end features across UI and backend.
  * Clear separation between UI and backend tiers for caching and scaling.
* Negative:
  * Potential scalability limits as all functionality resides in one codebase. Mitigated by horizontal scaling of stateless API instances.
  * Risk of tight coupling across modules over time; countered with clear module boundaries.
