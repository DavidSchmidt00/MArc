== Solution Strategy

This section summarizes the high-level design decisions and architectural approach for Prime-Cuts Booking. It outlines how the system will fulfill the key requirements and constraints through a cohesive solution strategy.

=== Architectural Style and Decomposition
* Monolithic, layered architecture (Presentation, API, Business Logic, Data Access) deployed as a two-tier system (SPA frontend & backend monolith).
* Clear separation of concerns: each layer focuses on a specific responsibility (e.g., REST controllers vs. business rules vs. persistence).
* Modular, domain-aligned packages (e.g., Booking, User Management, Staff, Services, Reporting).

=== Data Management Strategy
* Relational persistence using PostgreSQL for ACID transactions and complex queries (bookings, schedules, reporting).
* Redis as a distributed cache for availability queries and as a job queue for asynchronous notifications and reporting tasks.

=== Scalability and Performance
* Stateless backend instances behind a load balancer/API gateway for horizontal scale.
* CDN for static SPA delivery to minimize latency and improve global reach.
* Caching of availability results and throttling of expensive operations to maintain P95 API latency â‰¤ 2s.

=== Resilience and Reliability
* ACID-consistent booking operations with distributed locking (Redis) to prevent double-bookings.
* Automated backups and multi-AZ deployment of PostgreSQL.
* Monitoring, health checks, and auto-restart policies for containerized backend services.

=== Security and Compliance
* All transport secured via TLS; JWT-based authentication and RBAC for API endpoints.
* Encryption of sensitive customer/staff data at rest; GDPR-compliant data management.

=== Asynchrony and Integration
* Background workers (within the same codebase) subscribe to Redis job queues for sending email and SMS notifications, and for generating reports.
* Integrations with third-party providers (SendGrid, Twilio) abstracted behind service interfaces to allow future extensions.

=== Deployment and Operations
* Containerized deployment (Docker) orchestrated in Kubernetes (or equivalent), Infrastructure-as-Code for reproducibility.
* Centralized logging and metrics (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK) for observability and SLA monitoring.
