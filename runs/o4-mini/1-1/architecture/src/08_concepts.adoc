== Cross-Cutting Concepts

This section describes fundamental architectural concepts and patterns used across multiple modules.

=== Security
* TLS encryption for all transport.
* JWT-based authentication; role-based access control (RBAC) enforced in API middleware.
* Encryption of PII at rest (column-level or full-disk encryption in PostgreSQL).
* GDPR compliance: consent capture, data retention/purge policies.

=== Caching and Data Consistency
* Redis-based cache for availability queries, with time-to-live (TTL) and cache invalidation on schedule or booking updates.
* Distributed locks using Redis to enforce mutual exclusion on critical booking operations.

=== Asynchronous Processing
* Redis-backed job queue for background tasks (notifications, reporting).
* Job consumers (Notification Manager) within the same codebase as separate worker processes.
* Retry logic with exponential backoff; idempotent job handlers.

=== Observability
* Centralized logging with correlation IDs; structured JSON logs.
* Metrics exported to Prometheus (API latency, error rates, queue depths, DB performance).
* Alerting rules for SLA breaches (P95 >2 s, queue backlog > threshold, high DB error rates).

=== Resilience Patterns
* Circuit breaker on external calls (Email/SMS providers).
* Bulkhead isolation for job consumers to avoid cascading failures.
* Health endpoints for readiness/liveness; utilized by orchestration platform.

=== Modular Monolith
* Logical modules separated by domain contexts; packages within a single code repository.
* Clear API contracts between modules; internal use of repository pattern for data access.
* Feature flags for toggling upcoming capabilities (e.g., payment integration).
