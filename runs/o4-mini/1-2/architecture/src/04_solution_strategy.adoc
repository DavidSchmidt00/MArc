== Solution Strategy

We adopt a layered, monolithic architecture comprising a responsive SPA frontend and a single backend codebase. Key strategic decisions:

* Technology Stack
** Frontend: React or Vue.js SPA for mobile-first, responsive UI
** Backend: Node.js/Express or Python/Django for rapid development and ACID scheduling transactions
** Persistence: PostgreSQL (primary + read replicas) and Redis for caching and job queuing

* Architectural Patterns
** Layered pattern to separate presentation, API, domain, and persistence concerns.
** CQRS for reporting: read-optimized queries vs. write-side booking logic
** Event-driven integration (job queue) to decouple notifications and enable future extensibility (e.g., payments)
** Cache-aside strategy (Redis) for availability queries to satisfy performance SLAs.

* Quality Goals and Operational Strategy
** Reliability: Kubernetes (or VM auto-scaled) deployments behind load balancer, automated failover and health checks (99.5% uptime).
** Scalability: Stateless app servers, Redis-backed queue, DB replicas for read scaling.
** Security: TLS everywhere, JWT/session security, PII encrypted at rest, KMS-managed keys.
** Monitoring: Prometheus/Grafana for metrics; ELK for logs; alerts on high error/queue spike.

This strategy ensures the system meets usability, performance, reliability, and security requirements while remaining simple to operate and extend.
