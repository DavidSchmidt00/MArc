* Monolithic backend using a unified codebase (Node.js/Express or Python/Django).
* Frontend as a Single-Page Application (React or Vue.js).
* Data persistence in PostgreSQL, with Redis for caching and job queuing.
* No payment processing in initial release; must be extensible for future addition.
* Deployable as Docker containers (Kubernetes or VM-based).
* All client-server communication over TLS (>=1.2).
* Personal data must be encrypted at rest.
* Use of third-party SMS/email gateway (Twilio, SendGrid).
