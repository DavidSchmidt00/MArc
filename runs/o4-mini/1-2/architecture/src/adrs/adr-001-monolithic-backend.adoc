= ADR-001: Monolithic Backend Architecture

== Context

The team needs to choose a backend architecture for the Prime-Cuts Booking system. Key factors:

* Small team with limited resources and expertise.
* Scheduling operations require ACID transactions to prevent double bookings.
* Initial release scope excludes microservice-scale complexity.
* Deployment must be straightforward (single artifact).

== Decision

We will implement the backend as a monolithic application using Node.js/Express or Python/Django. All business logic, API endpoints, and data persistence reside in a single deployable artifact.

== Consequences

Positive:
* Simplified development and deployment pipeline.
* Easier local development and debugging.
* Single codebase for all domain logic and data access.

Negative:
* Potential for large codebase if not modularized properly.
* Scalability is coarse-grained (entire monolith vs. individual services).

Neutral:
* A well-modularized monolith can later be split if needed.
