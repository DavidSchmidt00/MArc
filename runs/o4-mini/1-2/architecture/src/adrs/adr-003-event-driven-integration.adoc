= ADR-003: Event-Driven Integration for Asynchronous Tasks

== Context

Booking confirmation and reminder notifications, as well as report generation, should not impede the responsiveness of booking operations. Key considerations:

* Synchronous notification calls during booking may increase response times and risk timeouts.
* Reports require aggregation over potentially large datasets.

== Decision

We will use an event-driven approach: booking domain events (BookingCreated, BookingChanged) are published to a Redis-backed job queue. Worker processes subscribe to the queue and handle notifications and report precomputations asynchronously.

== Consequences

Positive:
* Booking flow remains fast as tasks are offloaded.
* Improved system resilience; failures in notification/reporting do not affect booking.
* Extensible for future modules (e.g., payment processing) via event subscriptions.

Negative:
* Complexity of eventual consistency; notifications/reporting may lag behind real-time.
* Requires operational oversight of queue health and worker metrics.

Neutral:
* Additional infrastructure (Redis, worker nodes) to manage.
