= ADR-002: SPA Frontend Architecture

== Context

The Prime-Cuts Booking system requires a user interface for both customers and staff. Key considerations:

* Majority of customers will use mobile devices for booking.
* Booking and schedule flows must be completed in as few clicks as possible.
* UI changes and feature additions expected over time.

== Decision

We will implement the frontend as a Single-Page Application (SPA) using either React or Vue.js. The SPA will be responsive and mobile-first.

== Consequences

Positive:
* Rich, interactive user experience with minimal page reloads.
* Easier to achieve a mobile-first design and pass Lighthouse responsiveness audits.
* Single codebase for web and potential PWA.

Negative:
* Increased complexity in initial setup (build chain, client-side routing).
* SEO considerations require SSR or prerendering for public pages.

Neutral:
* Requires additional client-side state management (Redux or Vuex).
