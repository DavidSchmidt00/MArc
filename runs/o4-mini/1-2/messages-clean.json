This manual process is time-consuming, prone to errors (e.g., double bookings), and offers no flexibility for customers who want to book outside of business hours. \\nThe owner wants to modernize operations, improve customer experience, and reduce the administrative workload on the staff. \\nThe application should be straightforward and require minimal technical knowledge to operate.\\n\\n## Key Stakeholders\\n\\n- **Barbershop Owner**: Primary user of the admin interface. Needs to manage schedules, services, and view booking reports.\\n- **Barbers**: Will use the system to check their daily schedules.\\n- **Customers**: Will use the public-facing website to book, reschedule, or cancel their appointments.\\n- **Receptionist**: Will use the system to manage walk-in appointments and assist customers over the phone.\\n\\n## User Stories\\n\\n### Customer Stories\\n\\n- As a customer, I want to see available time slots for a specific service and barber, so that I can book an appointment at my convenience.\\n- As a customer, I want to create a simple profile with my name and contact details, so I don't have to enter them every time I book.\\n- As a customer, I want to receive an email and SMS confirmation for my new appointment, so I am sure it has been booked correctly.\\n- As a customer, I want to receive a reminder 24 hours before my appointment, so I don't forget it.\\n- As a customer, I want to be able to easily cancel or reschedule my appointment online up to 24 hours in advance.\\n- As a customer, I want to view my history of past and upcoming appointments.\\n\\n### Staff (Owner/Receptionist/Barber) Stories\\n\\n- As the barbershop owner, I want to define the services offered, including their name, duration, and price.\\n- As the barbershop owner, I want to manage my staff's profiles and their standard working hours and days off, so the system only shows real availability.\\n- As the barbershop owner, I want to view a daily, weekly, and monthly overview of all booked appointments for all barbers.\\n- As a barber, I want to be able to block specific time slots in my calendar for breaks or personal appointments.\\n- As a receptionist, I want to be able to book an appointment on behalf of a customer who calls or walks in.\\n- As the owner, I want to see a simple report on which services are most frequently booked, so I can understand my business better.\\n- As a barber, I want to see any notes a customer has left with their booking (e.g., \\\"allergic to a certain product\\\").\\n\\n## Quality Attributes\\n\\n- **Usability**: The system must be extremely easy to use for both customers and staff with no technical background. The booking process should be completable in just a few clicks.\\n- **Reliability**: The system must be available 24/7. The booking data must be accurate to avoid conflicts like double bookings.\\n- **Performance**: The page for viewing available slots should load within 2 seconds, even during peak hours.\\n- **Security**: Customer data (name, email, phone number) must be stored securely. No payment information will be handled initially.\\n\\n## Additional Information Important for the Project\\n\\n- The initial version will not handle payments. This is a potential feature for a future release.\\n- The application must be responsive and work flawlessly on mobile devices, as most customers are expected to book via their smartphones.\\n- The architecture will be a classic two-tier application: a single-page application (SPA) frontend (e.g., using React or Vue.js) and a monolithic backend (e.g., using Node.js/Express, Python/Django) with a single relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL).\\n\"}",

            "content": "Below is a set of Architecturally Significant Requirements (ASRs) distilled from the project description, user stories, quality attributes and constraints.  Each ASR includes an identifier, a concise statement, rationale, and a measurable fit criterion.\n\n1. ASR-01: Availability Calculation & Conflict Prevention  \n   \u2022 Statement  \n     \u2013 The system shall compute real-time availability per barber and per service, enforcing transactional booking so no two appointments ever overlap for the same resource.  \n   \u2022 Rationale  \n     \u2013 Preventing double bookings is core to system reliability and the primary business driver for modernization.  \n   \u2022 Fit Criterion  \n     \u2013 Under concurrent booking attempts (up to 100 simultaneous requests against one barber), the database must ensure zero conflicting appointments via transactional locks or optimistic concurrency, with no booking conflict observed in 100 test runs.\n\n2. ASR-02: Performance of Slot-Availability View  \n   \u2022 Statement  \n     \u2013 The \u201cchoose a time slot\u201d page shall render available slots in \u22642 seconds at the 95th percentile under peak load.  \n   \u2022 Rationale  \n     \u2013 Quick feedback is critical for user satisfaction and conversion, especially on mobile.  \n   \u2022 Fit Criterion  \n     \u2013 With a simulated 200 concurrent users browsing availability, end-to-end page load time (front-to-back) must be \u22642 s in 95% of requests over a 30-minute load test.\n\n3. ASR-03: 24/7 Reliability & High Uptime  \n   \u2022 Statement  \n     \u2013 The system must be available for booking at all times, targeting at least 99.5% uptime.  \n   \u2022 Rationale  \n     \u2013 Customers need to book outside business hours; downtime directly impacts revenue and reputation.  \n   \u2022 Fit Criterion  \n     \u2013 Over any rolling 30-day window, measured downtime must not exceed 3.65 hours.  \n\n4. ASR-04: Secure Customer Data Handling  \n   \u2022 Statement  \n     \u2013 All personal data (name, email, phone) must be stored encrypted at rest; all client-server traffic must use TLS.  \n   \u2022 Rationale  \n     \u2013 Even without payment data, customer PII must be protected to maintain trust and comply with data-protection best practices.  \n   \u2022 Fit Criterion  \n     \u2013 Encryption keys are managed per-environment; automated scans confirm no plaintext PII in the database or logs; TLS 1.2+ enforced on all endpoints.\n\n5. ASR-05: Responsive Single-Page Application (SPA)  \n   \u2022 Statement  \n     \u2013 The frontend shall be implemented as an SPA (e.g., React or Vue.js) and adapt seamlessly to mobile and desktop viewports.  \n   \u2022 Rationale  \n     \u2013 Most bookings occur on smartphones; a responsive SPA ensures the fewest clicks and highest usability.  \n   \u2022 Fit Criterion  \n     \u2013 Passes Google Lighthouse responsiveness audit with a score \u226590 on the mobile emulation profile.\n\n6. ASR-06: Notification Service for Email & SMS  \n   \u2022 Statement  \n     \u2013 The system shall send booking confirmations immediately and automated reminders 24 h before appointment via both email and SMS.  \n   \u2022 Rationale  \n     \u2013 Users expect prompt confirmation and reminders to reduce no-shows.  \n   \u2022 Fit Criterion  \n     \u2013 >99% of triggered notifications are delivered within 5 minutes of the event (booking or reminder) in end-to-end tests against the SMS/email gateway.\n\n7. ASR-07: Configurable Working Hours & Time-Off Blocks  \n   \u2022 Statement  \n     \u2013 The owner/barbers must be able to define per-barber working hours, days off, and ad hoc blocked slots (e.g., breaks), and the system must honor these in availability calculations.  \n   \u2022 Rationale  \n     \u2013 Accurate calendars depend on real staff schedules.  \n   \u2022 Fit Criterion  \n     \u2013 Admin UI allows CRUD operations on schedules; availability view never shows slots outside defined bounds in 100 randomized schedule scenarios.\n\n8. ASR-08: Reporting & Analytics Engine  \n   \u2022 Statement  \n     \u2013 The backend must aggregate booking data and provide daily/weekly/monthly reports on appointments per service and per barber.  \n   \u2022 Rationale  \n     \u2013 Business insights drive service offerings and staffing decisions.  \n   \u2022 Fit Criterion  \n     \u2013 Reports for a full month\u2019s data (e.g., 3,000 appointments) are generated and delivered via the admin UI within 5 seconds.\n\n9. ASR-09: Monolithic Backend with Relational Persistence  \n   \u2022 Statement  \n     \u2013 A single backend (e.g., Node.js/Express or Python/Django) shall expose RESTful or GraphQL endpoints, backed by PostgreSQL, to simplify deployment and maintenance.  \n   \u2022 Rationale  \n     \u2013 The team\u2019s skill set and the small scale favor monolith simplicity; relational models are a natural fit for scheduling data.  \n   \u2022 Fit Criterion  \n     \u2013 All functional flows (booking, admin management, notifications, reporting) are served from one deployable artifact; migrations and rollback tested in staging.\n\n10. ASR-10: Extensibility for Future Payment Feature  \n    \u2022 Statement  \n      \u2013 The architecture shall modularize the booking, notification, and reporting components so that a payment-processing module can be introduced later with minimal impact.  \n    \u2022 Rationale  \n      \u2013 Payments are deferred to a future release; the core design must not require a complete rewrite.  \n    \u2022 Fit Criterion  \n      \u2013 A stub \u201cpayment\u201d module can be dropped in, wired to existing appointment entities, and reachable via a new API route without altering core booking logic.\n\nThese ten ASRs capture the highest\u2010priority architectural drivers\u2014functional, non-functional, and constraint-driven\u2014that the ADA will use to guide the detailed design.",

Data Flow Scenarios  \n   \u2022 Booking a Slot  \n     1. Customer requests available slots \u2192 Frontend calls GET /availability \u2192 Backend reads from cache or computes from DB \u2192 returns JSON.  \n     2.

BookingCreated event published \u2192 Notification worker picks up, sends email/SMS.  \n   \u2022 Admin Schedule Update  \n     1. Admin updates staff hours or blocks \u2192 PUT /staff/{id}/schedule \u2192 Backend updates DB \u2192 invalidates relevant cache keys \u2192 changes reflected in next availability fetch.  \n   \u2022 Generating Reports  \n     1. Admin requests report \u2192 GET /reports?period=month \u2192 Reporting Service queries aggregate tables or materialized views \u2192 returns data within 5s.  \n\n4. Architectural Patterns & Justification  \n   \u2022 Layered (Presentation, API, Domain, Persistence) for clear separation of concerns and testability.  \n   \u2022 CQRS for Reporting \u2013 read-optimized replicas or pre-aggregated views satisfy ASR-08 performance.  \n   \u2022 Event-Driven Integration (In-process events + job queue) decouples booking logic from notifications, enabling future expansion (e.g., payment module).  \n   \u2022 Cache-Aside (Redis) for availability snaps addresses ASR-02 performance without sacrificing data freshness.  \n\n5. Nonfunctional & Operational Concerns  \n   \u2022 Reliability/Uptime: Deploy multiple app replicas behind LB, health checks, database replicas, automated failover, and rolling deployments (99.5% uptime).  \n   \u2022 Security: TLS everywhere, JWT/session with secure flags, PII encrypted at rest, key management via KMS.  \n   \u2022 Monitoring & Alerts: Real-time metrics (response times, error rates), log aggregation, alert on queue backlog and high conflict rates.  \n   \u2022 Extensibility: All modules exposed by interfaces; a future Payment Service can subscribe to booking events and extend the domain model without core changes.  \n\nThis high-level design meets the ASRs and provides a clear blueprint for the next phase.  The detailed component designs (API contracts, data schemas, UI wireframes) can now be elaborated.  \n\nI am ready for the detailed design iteration or for transfer to the Architecture Review Agent.",
