= ADR-004 EU-Resident Notification Providers
:toc:

== Status
Accepted – 2024-06-26

== Context
GDPR and project constraint: customer personal data must stay within EU data centres. Email and SMS SaaS providers often default to US regions.

== Decision
Use providers with EU-region endpoints only:
* Email – *SendGrid EU* sub-user + `api.eu.sendgrid.com`.
* SMS – *Twilio EU1* edge (`edge=dublin`) or *Vonage/Nexmo EU*.
Provider base URL and credentials are injected via environment variables; provider adapters must refuse to start if a non-EU endpoint is configured.

== Consequences
+ Satisfies legal/data-residency requirement.
+ Minimal code impact (just base URL change) thanks to adapter abstraction.
− Some features (e.g., Twilio Studio) not yet available in EU region; acceptable for MVP.
