= ADR-002 PostgreSQL Exclusion Constraint for Conflict-Free Booking
:toc:

== Status
Accepted – 2024-06-26

== Context
Core business rule: no two appointments may overlap for the same barber.  Multiple concurrent booking requests can target the same slot.  Need an atomic guarantee enforced at persistence layer.
Options considered:
* Application-level locking using SELECT … FOR UPDATE.
* Advisory locks keyed by barber & time range.
* Database-level constraint (GiST exclusion constraint).

== Decision
We will enforce the rule using a PostgreSQL *GiST exclusion constraint* on `appointment (barber_id, tstzrange(start_ts, end_ts))`.  The application will retry up to 3 times on constraint violation and return HTTP 409 if still conflicting.

== Consequences
+ Guarantee provided directly by the database → fewer race conditions.
+ Simple code: just an INSERT; errors handled uniformly.
+ Index assists slot-availability queries.
− Couples data store choice to PostgreSQL specific feature (acceptable).
− Write contention can cause retries under very high load (monitored via metric `slot_booking_conflict_total`).
