= ADR-003 Transactional Outbox with RabbitMQ
:toc:

== Status
Accepted – 2024-06-26

== Context
Booking operations must emit events (AppointmentCreated, Changed, ReminderNeeded) that drive notifications and future integrations. If the message queue is unavailable at commit time, events could be lost or require complex 2-phase commits.

== Decision
Adopt the *Transactional Outbox* pattern:
1. Within the same database transaction that mutates business data, insert a row into `notification_outbox` table.
2. A separate *OutboxRelay* worker polls unsent rows and publishes them to RabbitMQ, marking rows as sent in its own transaction.
3. RabbitMQ provides durable queues; Notification Worker consumes and processes messages.

== Consequences
+ Events are stored atomically with domain data → never lost.
+ Decouples booking latency from external MQ/API availability.
+ Simpler than XA/2PC; compatible with PostgreSQL.
− Requires an additional polling process and table cleanup.
− Slight replication lag (<1 s) between event creation and delivery.
