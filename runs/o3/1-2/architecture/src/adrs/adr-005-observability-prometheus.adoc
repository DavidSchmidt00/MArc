= ADR-005 Observability with Prometheus & Structured Logs
:toc:

== Status
Accepted – 2024-06-26

== Context
ASRs specify ≥99.5 % uptime and rapid diagnosis. Need metrics, logs and alerts across web app and workers.

== Decision
*Expose Prometheus metrics* from each service at `/metrics` via prom-client library.  Key metrics include HTTP latency, queue depth, booking conflicts, notification success/failure.
*Structured JSON logging* using pino; logs shipped to Papertrail/Splunk.
*Alerting* via Grafana Cloud or Hosted Prometheus Alerts; thresholds configured for uptime, error ratios, queue depth.

== Consequences
+ Unified metrics/alerting stack simplifies ops.
+ JSON logs parseable and correlated via `request_id`.
− Slight memory/CPU overhead for metrics collection (negligible).
