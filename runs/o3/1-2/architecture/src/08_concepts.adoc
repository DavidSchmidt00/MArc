= 8. Cross-cutting Concepts
:toc:

== Security
* JWT-based stateless auth, roles: CUSTOMER, BARBER, OWNER.
* HTTPS enforced via HSTS; no mixed content.
* PII columns (`email`, `phone`) encrypted with pgcrypto.
* Secrets stored in PaaS config vars / AWS Secrets Manager.

== Persistence
* Single PostgreSQL schema.
* `appointment` table has GiST exclusion constraint to prevent overlaps.
* Outbox pattern for reliable event publication.

== Error Handling
* Domain errors → HTTP 4xx.
* Infrastructure errors → HTTP 5xx + log with request_id.
* Booking conflicts return 409.

== Logging & Monitoring
* JSON logs with request_id, user_id.
* Prometheus metrics exposed at `/metrics`.
* Alerts: uptime, queue depth, booking conflict ratio.

== Configuration
* Twelve-Factor App: environment variables, no config files checked in.

== Test Strategy
* Unit tests (Jest) for domain logic – ≥80 % coverage, enforced in CI.
* Integration tests with postgres-testcontainer.
* Load tests (Artillery) executed in CI nightly.

== Internationalisation
* Single locale (en-GB) initially. Time-zone stored and processed in UTC, rendered in shop local time.
