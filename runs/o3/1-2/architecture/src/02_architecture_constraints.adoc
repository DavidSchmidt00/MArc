= 2. Architecture Constraints
:toc:

== Business Constraints
* Budget of a small local business – prefer low-cost PaaS offerings (Heroku free/low-tier, AWS Lightsail/Fargate, etc.).
* MVP within ~2 months – favour productivity over bleeding-edge tech.
* EU GDPR compliance; personal data must stay in EU data-centres.

== Technical Constraints
* Tech stack: JavaScript/TypeScript as primary language across front-end and back-end (React SPA, Node.js 18 LTS).
* Relational database (PostgreSQL ≥14) for ACID booking transactions.
* Communication must be HTTPS-only.
* Notification channels via SaaS e-mail (SendGrid EU) and SMS (Twilio EU or Vonage EU).
* Deployment uses containers (Docker); CI/CD via GitHub Actions.

== Organisational Constraints
* Single small dev team (~3 members) – common codebase preferred.
* Limited ops expertise – leverage managed services for DB, MQ, SMTP/SMS gateways.

== Regulatory Constraints
* GDPR – right to access and deletion, logs must be redacted.
* No payment data processed (out of scope for MVP) thus PCI-DSS not applicable yet.
