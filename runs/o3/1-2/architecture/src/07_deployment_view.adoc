== Infrastructure Overview
|===
|Component | Technology | Deployment Target | Scaling | Notes
|React SPA | Static files (HTML/JS/CSS) | Cloudflare CDN | Geo-replicated | TLS termination, caching.
|Node.js Backend | Docker image | Heroku (Container stack) or AWS Fargate | 2× web containers | Auto-restart, rolling deploys.
|PostgreSQL DB | Managed Postgres | Heroku Postgres or AWS RDS | Primary + automated backups | Encrypted volume, PITR.
|RabbitMQ | CloudAMQP “Little Lemur” | Multi-AZ | 1 (can scale) | Provides DLQ.
|Redis (optional) | Upstash / Heroku Redis | Single node | — | Caches availability queries.
|Notification Worker | Docker image | Heroku worker dyno / Fargate task | 2 replicas | Stateless.
|Reminder Scheduler | Heroku Scheduler dyno / AWS EventBridge | 1 | Scheduled every 5 min | Lightweight.

== Deployment Qualities
* Zero-downtime deploys supported by rolling container replacement.
* Secure transport – all traffic via TLS 1.2+.
* Backups: DB automated daily + WAL, RabbitMQ persistent queues, CDN static assets versioned in CI.
* Infrastructure as Code (Dockerfiles, `app.json` or Terraform if AWS).
