= 4. Solution Strategy
:toc:

*Modular Monolith with Hexagonal Architecture*
Keeps deployment simple and low-cost while establishing clear internal boundaries so modules can later be extracted as micro-services.

*PostgreSQL + Exclusion Constraint for Conflict-Free Booking*
Guarantees no overlapping appointments per barber via GiST index; simple retry logic handles contention.

*Transactional Outbox + RabbitMQ*
Ensures reliable delivery of domain events even if the message broker is unavailable at commit time.

*React SPA*
Provides responsive, mobile-first UI with rapid interactions (<2 s slot query).

*Managed PaaS Infrastructure*
Heroku/AWS Fargate etc. reduce ops burden; Cloudflare CDN terminates TLS.

*EU-Resident SaaS Notification Providers*
SendGrid EU and Twilio/Vonage EU comply with GDPR data-residency constraints.

*Observability Built-In*
Health probes, Prometheus metrics, structured logs; alerting on uptime, queue depth, booking conflicts.
