== 1. Introduction and Goals

=== 1.1 Purpose of this Document
This arc42 document captures the architecture of the **“InsureSphere CRM”** integration project for the insurance company.  It serves as the single point of truth regarding the major architectural building blocks, their interactions, and the rationale behind key technical decisions.  The intended audience are developers, architects, operations, security & compliance officers, and other stakeholders.

=== 1.2 Requirements Overview
The project replaces several siloed front-office applications with a modern CRM that provides a 360-degree customer view.  It must integrate tightly with four heterogeneous legacy systems (Policy Mainframe, Claims, Billing, Data-Warehouse) and an external marketing platform.  The most important quality attributes are Integration & Interoperability, Data Consistency, Security & Compliance, Reliability, and Usability.  A complete list of Architecturally Significant Requirements (ASRs) is captured in section 10.
