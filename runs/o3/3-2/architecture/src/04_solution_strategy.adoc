== Solution Strategy

This section summarises the fundamental, *approved* decisions that shape the architecture of **InsureSphere CRM**. Each entry is backed by a dedicated Architecture Decision Record (ADR).

|===
|Area | Decision | Rationale | ADR

| Architectural style
| Adopt a domain-driven, service-oriented, event-driven micro-service architecture with hexagonal (ports-and-adapters) pattern; apply *Strangler Fig* for phased legacy replacement.
| Enables independent evolution, clear bounded contexts, and risk-free migration of legacy front-office functions. 
| xref:adrs/adr-001-architectural-style.adoc[ADR-001]

| Integration & Interoperability
| Use a central Integration Platform (MuleSoft Runtime Fabric – primary; Azure Integration Services – fallback) as Enterprise Service Bus plus Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL) adapters for every legacy system.
| Simplifies protocol conversion (MQ ↔ Kafka, batch, CDC) and isolates the domain model from legacy inconsistencies.
| ADR-002

| Communication paradigm
| Async events over *Confluent Kafka* for all cross-service interactions; *REST/GraphQL* for synchronous queries.
| Guarantees loose coupling, horizontal scalability, and natural audit trail of business events.
| ADR-003

| Consistency guarantees
| Implement *Transactional Outbox* + *Debezium* CDC for exactly-once event publishing; prefix all commands with global _Idempotency-Key_.
| Satisfies the ≤5 min propagation ASR and prevents duplicates across batch integrations.
| ADR-004

| State management
| Apply *CQRS + Event Sourcing* in Customer and Task contexts, ordinary CRUD elsewhere.
| Provides full auditability (10-year retention) and cheap materialised views for performant dashboard queries.
| ADR-005

| Long-running transactions
| Model complex workflows (Address change, FNOL) as *Sagas* orchestrated by *Camunda 8*.
| Ensures reliable compensation across heterogeneous legacy endpoints and visibility for Ops.
| ADR-006

| Data residency & compliance
| All production data stored in EU regions; PII leaving EU (to Salesforce Marketing Cloud) is tokenised via Vault Transit.
| Satisfies GDPR and BaFin residency requirements while enabling marketing automation use-cases.
| ADR-007

| Observability & SLA monitoring
| Uniform Micrometer metrics → Prometheus → Grafana; Alertmanager routes violations within 1 minute.
| Meets ASR #13 (audit & monitoring) and allows objective quality-gate automation.
| ADR-008

| Disaster Recovery
| Active–passive topology (Azure West EU ⟷ North EU) with ≤4 h RTO / 15 min RPO; quarterly chaos tests.
| Essential for the 99.9 % availability target and regulatory DR evidence.
| ADR-009
