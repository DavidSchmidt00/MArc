= ADR-006 Saga Orchestration with Camunda 8

== Context
Address change, FNOL, and quote generation span multiple services and legacy systems with potential partial failures and long-running transactions.

== Decision
Implement Sagas using Camunda 8 as the workflow engine.  Each step is triggered by events; compensating actions are defined for rollback.  Timeouts escalate to human tasks.

== Consequences
* ✅  Clear visibility and monitoring of business processes.
* ✅  Standardised compensation logic across workflows.
* ⚠  Additional infrastructure (Camunda cluster) and modelling effort.
