= ADR-007 Data Residency & Tokenisation

== Context
GDPR and BaFin require EU data residency.  Salesforce Marketing Cloud operates in the US and needs customer information for campaigns.

== Decision
All primary and DR environments run exclusively in EU regions.  Before data leaves the EU, PII attributes are tokenised via HashiCorp Vault Transit.  Only tokens are sent to Salesforce; mapping tables stay EU-only.

== Consequences
* ✅  Compliance with GDPR data-residency rules.
* ✅  Marketing integration proceeds without exposing raw PII.
* ⚠  Additional indirection when troubleshooting campaign data.
