= ADR-001: Architectural Style & Guiding Patterns

Date: 2024-04-27

== Status
Accepted

== Context
The "InsureSphere CRM" must replace multiple legacy front-office systems, integrate with four heterogeneous back-end systems, support phased migration, and satisfy stringent quality attributes around integration, data consistency, security, and reliability.

== Decision
Adopt a distributed architecture composed of:

* Microservices organised by domain‚Äêdriven bounded contexts and deployed on Kubernetes.
* Hexagonal (Ports-and-Adapters) architecture at service level.
* Event-driven communication (Kafka, CloudEvents) with CQRS + Event Sourcing for customer master data.
* Strangler-Fig pattern to migrate existing front-office functionality.
* Saga / Process-Manager pattern for long-running, cross-system workflows.
* Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL) for every legacy integration edge.
* API-first approach (REST/GraphQL + AsyncAPI) to expose all capabilities.

== Rationale
These patterns directly address the key quality goals:
* Loose coupling & interoperability via events and APIs.
* Evolvability and phased rollout enabled by Strangler-Fig.
* Data consistency and auditability through CQRS + ES.
* Isolation from legacy quirks via ACL.

== Consequences
Positive:
* Independent deployability and scaling per microservice.
* Clear separation between domain logic and integration details.
* Supports graceful degradation when back-ends are unavailable.

Negative:
* Added operational complexity (Kafka, multiple data stores, workflow engine).
* Requires disciplined event and schema governance.
