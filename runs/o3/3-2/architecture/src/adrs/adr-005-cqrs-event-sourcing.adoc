= ADR-005 CQRS + Event Sourcing for Customer & Task Contexts

== Context
Customer 360 dashboard and audit requirements (10-year history) demand historical reconstruction.  The workload is read-heavy but requires traceability of changes.

== Decision
Apply *CQRS + Event Sourcing* to Customer and Task bounded contexts: write model stores events, read model builds materialised Postgres/Elastic views via Kafka consumers.

== Consequences
* ✅  Full audit trail and lightweight temporal queries.
* ✅  Scalable read side optimised for dashboard performance.
* ⚠  Higher complexity, dual models, eventual consistency.
