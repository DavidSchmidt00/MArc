= ADR-004 Exactly-Once Event Publishing – Transactional Outbox

== Context
Duplicate events can lead to inconsistent customer data across CRM and legacy systems.  We need exactly-once semantics despite distributed components and batch integrations.

== Decision
Every microservice persists domain events into a local *Outbox* table within the same transaction as state changes.  Debezium streams these rows to Kafka.  Commands carry a global *Idempotency-Key* header checked by consumers; processed keys are stored in a compacted topic.

== Consequences
* ✅  Atomic state + event write → no lost updates.
* ✅  Duplicate suppression across retries and network glitches.
* ⚠  Additional storage and operational cost for Debezium connectors.
