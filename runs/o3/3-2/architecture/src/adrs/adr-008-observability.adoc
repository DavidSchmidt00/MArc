= ADR-008 Observability & SLA Monitoring

== Context
ASR #13 requires centralised logging, distributed tracing, SLA dashboards, and 1-minute alerting on violations.

== Decision
Adopt Micrometer → Prometheus → Grafana stack for metrics; Loki for logs; Jaeger for tracing.  Alertmanager routes critical alerts to Ops and Teams chat with ≤1 minute latency.

== Consequences
* ✅  Uniform instrumentation across all JVM services.
* ✅  Objective SLO tracking and early warning for degradations.
* ⚠  Need to manage metrics cardinality and storage retention.
