== Deployment View

This section documents how the InsureSphere CRM software artifacts are deployed onto the underlying technical infrastructure across environments (production and disaster-recovery). It covers the distribution of containers, databases, messaging infrastructure, and integration runtimes, as well as their physical locations and communication channels.

=== Infrastructure Level 1 – Production & DR Topology

....

Motivation::

The CRM is mission-critical and must achieve 99.9 % availability with an RTO ≤ 4 h and RPO ≤ 15 min. Therefore, it is deployed in an active-passive multi-region setup within EU data-centres (Azure West Europe primary, Azure North Europe DR). All stateful components replicate asynchronously to the DR region. Stateless workloads can be redeployed from Git (ArgoCD) during a fail-over.

Quality & Performance Features::

* High Availability: Multi-AZ Kubernetes cluster; database geo-replication; Kafka MirrorMaker 2 multi-region cluster.
* Scalability: AKS with HPA; Kafka partitioning; database vertical/ horizontal scaling.
* Security & Compliance: All resources remain in EU; encryption in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest; firewall rules restrict cross-region exposure.
* Observability: Prometheus federation aggregates metrics from both regions; Alertmanager routes region-specific alerts.

Mapping of Building Blocks to Infrastructure::

|===
| Building Block | Deployment Target (Primary) | Deployment Target (DR)
| Domain Microservices | AKS Cluster (West EU) | AKS Cluster (North EU)
| API Gateway (Kong) | AKS Cluster (West EU) | AKS Cluster (North EU)
| PostgreSQL | Flexible Server (West EU) | Geo-Replica (North EU)
| Kafka | Confluent Cloud / Self-Host Brokers (West EU) | Mirror Brokers (North EU)
| Camunda 8 | SaaS (dual-region EU) | SaaS (same)
| MuleSoft RTF (Adapters) | VM Scale Set (West EU) | Stand-by VMSS (North EU)
| Audit Blob Storage | Azure Storage (West EU) | Geo-replicated Blob (North EU)

=== Infrastructure Level 2 – AKS Cluster (Primary)

:leveloffset: +1
==== Kubernetes Namespace Layout
[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Namespace | Purpose / Workloads
| gateway | API Gateway pods, horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA)
| crm | Domain microservices, Redis instances
| integration | Kafka Connect (Debezium), schema registry sidecars
| observability | Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Jaeger agents
| shared | Vault Agent Injector, NGINX Ingress Controller
|===

==== Network Policies & Ingress
* Calico network policies restrict egress from crm namespace to only Kafka, PostgreSQL, and internal services.
* Azure Application Gateway provides WAF-enabled public ingress → NGINX ingress for path routing.

==== Storage Classes
* Premium SSD (PostgreSQL), Ultra Disk for Kafka ZooKeeper, Azure Files for read-only config maps.
