= ADR-002 Prevent Double-Booking with PostgreSQL EXCLUDE Constraint

== Context

A key quality goal is data integrity: the system must guarantee no overlapping appointments for the same barber. We need a server-side mechanism that works under concurrency and is easy to maintain.

Alternatives evaluated:

1. Application-level checks with optimistic locking.
2. Redis-based distributed lock per staff/time.
3. Database constraint using PostgreSQL `EXCLUDE` with `tstzrange` (plus SERIALIZABLE isolation).

== Decision

Implement an `EXCLUDE USING gist (staff_id WITH =, time_range WITH &&)` constraint on the `appointments` table (`time_range` is a `tstzrange`). Booking commands run in a SERIALIZABLE transaction.

== Consequences

+ Single source of truth; database guarantees integrity regardless of application bugs.
+ Simple, declarative, easy to test.
+ Scales with horizontal API replicas (all share same DB).
− Couples the solution to PostgreSQL (acceptable due to AC-01).
− Slight overhead from GiST index maintenance (negligible for expected volume).
