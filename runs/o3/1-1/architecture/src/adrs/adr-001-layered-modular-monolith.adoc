= ADR-001 Choose Layered Modular-Monolith

== Context

Prime-Cuts Booking must support ~100 concurrent users, deliver 99.9 % availability, and stay “as simple and cheap as possible”. The team has 3 full-stack developers experienced with Node.js/React but no dedicated DevOps staff. Managed PaaS offerings (Heroku, AWS Fargate) are available.

We considered three architectural styles:

* Microservices per bounded context
* Monolithic 3-tier (classic MVC)
* Layered Modular-Monolith (Hexagonal / Ports & Adapters)

== Decision

We will implement the backend as a single deployable artifact (container/dyno) following a Layered Modular-Monolith style with clear module boundaries (Booking, Scheduling, Admin, Notifications). Each module exposes ports/interfaces; infrastructure details are isolated in adapters.

== Consequences

+ Lower operational overhead: one service to deploy, monitor, and scale horizontally.
+ In-process calls avoid network latency and distributed-transaction complexity.
+ Clear module boundaries preserve ability to extract microservices later if scale demands.
+ Simpler local development and CI pipeline.
− A failure in the process can affect all modules (mitigated by horizontal replicas + health checks).
− Scaling must be coarse-grained (entire application), which is acceptable for projected load.
