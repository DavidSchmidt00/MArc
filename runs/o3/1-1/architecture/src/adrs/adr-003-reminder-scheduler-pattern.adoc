= ADR-003 Reliable 24-h Reminder Scheduling via EventBridge + SQS Delayed Messages

== Context

The system must send reminders 24 hours before each appointment. AWS SQS supports up to 15-minute delays; we need near-exact 24-hour scheduling without running a permanent scheduler service.

Options:

1. Cron job scanning DB every minute (costly, potential race conditions).
2. Use a specialised scheduler service (e.g., Quartz, Temporal) – increases ops complexity.
3. Two-stage scheduling: periodic EventBridge rule scans for appointments starting in 24 h and enqueues an SQS message with remaining delay (≤15 min). Lambda worker processes queue.

== Decision

Adopt option 3: 

* EventBridge rule triggers every 10 minutes.
* Lambda scan queries appointments with start time between now+24 h and now+24 h+10 min.
* For each match, publish to `reminder-due` SQS with `DelaySeconds = appointment_start − (now + 24 h)`.
* Worker Lambda consumes queue, sends e-mail/SMS via SendGrid/Twilio. DLQ captures failures; CloudWatch alarm on DLQ >0.

== Consequences

+ Serverless, pay-per-use, no always-on scheduler maintenance.
+ At-least-once delivery; idempotent token prevents duplicates.
+ Acceptable timing precision (≤10 min) for business needs.
− Complexity spread across two Lambdas and EventBridge rule.
− Dependent on AWS services (vendor lock-in mitigated by abstraction layer).
