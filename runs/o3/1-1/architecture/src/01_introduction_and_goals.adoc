=== Quality goals (top 5)

|===
|Priority |Quality goal |Motivation (concrete scenario)
|1 |Reliability & Data integrity |Any attempt to create an overlapping appointment for the same barber is rejected; no double-bookings even with 100 concurrent requests.
|2 |Usability |A first-time customer can finish a booking on a mobile phone within 30 s without guidance.
|3 |Performance |Slot-availability page renders < 2 s for 95 % of requests at Saturday 10 a.m. peak (≈100 concurrent users).
|4 |Security & Privacy |All personal data is transmitted via HTTPS and stored encrypted; only authenticated roles may access their respective information.
|5 |Modifiability |Adding online payments in a future release requires no changes to scheduling logic nor data model for appointments.
