=== Technical Context

All client applications communicate with the platform via HTTPS through the API Gateway.  Real-time updates are delivered using WebSocket connections upgraded at the gateway edge.  Internal microservices communicate over gRPC (synchronous) and Kafka (asynchronous) within an mTLS-secured service mesh on Kubernetes.
