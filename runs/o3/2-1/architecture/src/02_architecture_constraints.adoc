== Architecture Constraints

=== Technical Constraints

|===
|Constraint|Rationale
|Microservice architecture with database-per-service (ASR-C01)|Enables independent scaling & deployment; mandated by maintainability goal.
|Primary cloud deployment on AWS (EKS, RDS, MSK)|Corporate cloud strategy and existing contracts.
|Container orchestration via Kubernetes|Standard runtime chosen by infra team; multi-AZ support.
|Service Mesh (Istio) with mTLS enforced|Zero-trust security baseline across services.
|Event backbone: Apache Kafka (AWS MSK)|Meets throughput/latency requirements for real-time messaging.
|Payments via Stripe & PayPal adapters|PCI-compliant providers approved by finance.
|Mapping via Google Maps Platform|Most accurate routing/ETA data for target regions.
|===

=== Organizational Constraints

|===
|Constraint|Rationale
|Three autonomous product squads (Customer, Restaurant, Logistics)|Team organisation already established.
|Weekly production releases permitted on Thursdays only|Operations change-management window.
|Infrastructure managed by central SRE team|Separation of concerns, cost governance.
|===

=== Conventions & Standards

|===
|Constraint|Rationale
|Coding languages: Kotlin/JVM for backend, TypeScript for frontend/mobile (React Native)|Existing skillsets and code reuse.
|API style: REST/JSON for external, gRPC/protobuf for internal|Consistency and performance.
|Documentation standard: arc42 + ADRs|Company standard for architectural documentation.
|IaC: Terraform + Helm charts|Align with SRE automation pipelines.
|Observability: OpenTelemetry semantic conventions|Uniform metrics/tracing across services.
