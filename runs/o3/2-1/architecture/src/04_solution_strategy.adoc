== Solution Strategy

The solution follows a cloud-native, microservice architecture to satisfy the key drivers of scalability, real-time responsiveness, high availability, and independent team delivery.

=== Architectural Pattern & Decomposition

* Microservices per bounded context (Customer, Restaurant, Logistics) with database-per-service to enable autonomous evolution.
* Event-driven architecture with Apache Kafka for loose-coupling and near real-time asynchronous communication.
* CQRS for write-heavy menu/order flows, separating update and query models for optimal performance.
* Saga pattern to coordinate distributed transactions across Order, Payment, and Dispatch services.
* API Gateway façade (REST/GraphQL + WebSockets) provides a unified, secure edge for all client applications.

=== Technology Decisions

|Technology|Purpose|Motivation
|Kubernetes (EKS)|Container orchestration|Scales horizontally, multi-AZ HA, aligns with corporate infra.
|Istio Service Mesh|Traffic management, mTLS|Zero-trust security, retries, circuit breaking.
|Apache Kafka (MSK)|Event backbone|High throughput & low latency for order/driver events.
|PostgreSQL (Aurora)|Transactional data|ACID compliance for financial & order state.
|MongoDB / DynamoDB|Document data|Flexible menu catalogue & location snapshots.
|Redis Cluster|Caching & sessions|Millisecond read latency for menus, search, carts.
|Stripe / PayPal SDKs|Payments|PCI-compliant providers already approved.
|OpenTelemetry Stack|Observability|Unified metrics, logs, traces.

=== Quality Goal Realisation

*Scalability* – Stateless service replicas, auto-scaling, sharded databases, Kafka partitions.

*Real-time* – WebSockets for push; Kafka + low-latency stores; SLA ≤2 s.

*Availability* – Multi-AZ deployments, health probes, automated failover, graceful degradation.

*Security & Compliance* – mTLS inside mesh, JWT/OIDC outside, Vault secrets, PCI scope isolation.

*Maintainability* – Clear service ownership, CI/CD per repo, infrastructure-as-code, ADRs.

=== Organisational Decisions

* Three product squads own their bounded contexts; shared platform services are maintained by the SRE guild.
* Release cadence: weekly production push (Thursday window) with progressive delivery (canary / feature flags).
* Documentation standard: arc42 template + Architecture Decision Records stored in Git.
