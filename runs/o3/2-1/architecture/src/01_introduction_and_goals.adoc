=== Requirements Overview

*Functional Scope*

|===
|ID | Requirement (summary)
|CUS-BROWSE | Customers can discover restaurants via search & filtering.
|CUS-ORDER  | Customers can compose a cart, pay securely, and place an order.
|CUS-TRACK  | Customers can track order & driver location in real time.
|RES-MANAGE | Restaurants manage menus, pricing, availability, and accept/decline orders.
|DRV-DISPATCH| Drivers set availability, receive delivery offers, navigate, and complete deliveries.
|ADM-OPS    | Platform administrators monitor operations, support users, and manage fees & payouts.

The complete list of user stories is maintained in `projects/project-2.md`.  The above table captures the architecturally significant capabilities that drive the design.

=== Quality Goals (Top-5)

|===
|Priority|Quality Goal|Scenario / Acceptance Criterion
|1|Scalability|System sustains 5× normal lunch-rush load (>100 k concurrent sessions, 10 k active orders) without SLO violation.
|2|Real-time Responsiveness|Order state changes and driver GPS updates propagate to all interested parties within ≤2 s 95 % of the time.
|3|High Availability|≥99.95 % monthly uptime for core ordering functions; no single point of failure.
|4|Security & Compliance|All payments PCI-DSS-compliant; personal data GDPR/CCPA compliant with export/erasure workflows.
|5|Maintainability & Team Autonomy|Three product squads release independently at least weekly; service boundaries minimise cross-team coordination.
