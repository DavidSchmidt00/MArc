= ADR-002 Event Backbone using Apache Kafka

Date: 2024-03-15

== Status
Accepted

== Context
Real-time requirements dictate propagation of order status and driver location within 2 seconds. A message broker is required for loose coupling between services. Alternatives considered: RabbitMQ, AWS SNS/SQS, Google Pub/Sub.

== Decision
Adopt Apache Kafka (AWS MSK managed) as the central event backbone. Events will use Protobuf schemas with a Schema Registry. Partitions will be sized per domain (e.g., order-id hash, geohash for GPS) to ensure scalability.

== Consequences
* ✅ High throughput & low latency suitable for GPS streams.
* ✅ Replay capability for CQRS read models & analytics.
* ✅ Broad ecosystem support (Kafka Streams, ksqlDB).
* ⚠️ Operational overhead (topic management, partition sizing).
* ⚠️ Requires exactly-once semantics config for payment events.
