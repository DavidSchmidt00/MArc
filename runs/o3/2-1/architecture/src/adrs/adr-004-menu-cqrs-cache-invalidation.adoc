= ADR-004: CQRS-Based Menu Service with Event-Driven Cache Invalidation

Date: 2023-11-27
Status: Accepted

== Context
Restaurant managers need to update menu items (prices, descriptions, availability) and see those changes reflected to customers in ≤ 5 s (ASR-F04). Read-side traffic (customer catalogue queries) is two orders of magnitude higher than write traffic and must meet P99 latency < 300 ms.  The system already follows microservice and event-backbone decisions (ADR-001, ADR-002).

== Decision
Implement the Restaurant Menu bounded-context with a **Command/Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)** pattern and an **event-driven cache-invalidation pipeline**:

* **Write Side**: REST/gRPC Menu Cmd API persists changes to PostgreSQL (or event-store).
* **Outbox Pattern**: write-side transaction inserts into `menu_outbox`; Debezium streams `MenuUpdate` events to Kafka topic `menu-updates` guaranteeing at-least-once delivery.
* **Read Side**: Snapshot Builder consumes `menu-updates`, (re)builds denormalised catalogue JSON and writes to Redis (hot) and S3 (cold backup).
* **Edge Propagation**: Cache Invalidation Service and Customer-WebSocket Hub also consume `menu-updates`, purge CDN objects, and push `menuRefresh` notifications.

== Considered Alternatives

1. Single relational DB with immediate reads
   * Pros: simpler.
   * Cons: cannot sustain required read volume; hot row contention; fails ≤ 5 s propagation due to absent edge invalidation.

2. Dual write: API updates DB *and* Redis synchronously
   * Pros: easy to reason.
   * Cons: distributed transaction risk; potential inconsistency; still no CDN purge/websocket.

3. Event sourcing without separate read model
   * Pros: audit friendly.
   * Cons: expensive query reconstruction; still needs cache layer; more complex for Restaurant squad.

== Consequences

* + Read path highly optimised (Redis/Edge) → meets latency targets.
* + Propagation latency deterministic; measurable from DB commit to CDN purge.
* + Clear separation of concerns enables independent scaling of write, read, and invalidation paths.
* – Additional operational components (Debezium, Snapshot Builder, CDN Purger).
* – Requires schema-evolution discipline for Kafka event.
