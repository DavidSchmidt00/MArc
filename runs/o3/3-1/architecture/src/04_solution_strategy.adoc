== Solution Strategy

The solution strategy captures the core ideas and key decisions that shape the overall architecture of *InsureSphere CRM*.
It gives stakeholders an at-a-glance understanding of _how_ we intend to reach the project goals and satisfy the architecturally significant requirements (ASRs).

=== 1. Architectural Style

* Domain-oriented **microservices** deployed as Docker containers on OpenShift 4.x
* **Event-driven** integration via Apache Kafka with Avro-encoded, schema-managed topics
* **Backend-for-Frontend (BFF)** pattern for tailor-made APIs per persona (Agent, Support, Admin)
* **API- and Event-centric** interfaces; REST/GraphQL for synchronous calls, Kafka topics for asynchronous communication
* **Strangler-Fig** approach to phase out legacy front-office applications

=== 2. Key Technology Decisions

|===
|Area | Decision | Rationale | ASRs covered

| Integration Hub
| Apache Camel-K (Kubernetes-native Camel operator)
| Open-source, developer familiarity, light runtime; aligns with existing Spring skill set; runs natively in OpenShift service mesh
| Integration #1, Reliability #4, Modularity #7

| Messaging Backbone
| Apache Kafka (Strimzi operator) with Confluent Schema Registry
| High throughput, exactly-once semantics, rich ecosystem (Debezium, MirrorMaker2)
| Integration #1, Consistency #2, Auditability #8, Reliability #4

| Consistency Mechanism
| Dual-mode: (a) **LRA-based 2-phase commit** for *strong* entities (address, policy status); (b) **Outbox/Saga** for eventual consistency
| Balances latency vs. integrity; avoids global locking except where mandated
| Consistency #2, Reliability #4

| Security & Access Control
| **Keycloak** for SSO (OIDC/SAML) + **3scale** API Gateway; Kafka OAuth with fine-grained ACLs
| Centralised RBAC, GDPR consent scopes, rate limiting, audit trails
| Security #3, Auditability #8

| Data Privacy
| **Cryptographic Delete** – field-level AES-256 encryption with per-customer DEK stored in Vault
| Enables GDPR right-to-erasure while preserving immutable audit log
| Security #3, Auditability #8

| Disaster Recovery
| Active/Passive OpenShift regions; PostgreSQL logical replication, Kafka MirrorMaker2, ArgoCD automated fail-over
| Meets 99.9 % uptime SLA, RPO 5 min, RTO 15 min
| Reliability #4

=== 3. Architecture Overview (Container View)

=== 4. How the Strategy Addresses Quality Goals

* **Integration & Interoperability** – Canonical events on Kafka + Camel-K Anti-Corruption Layers hide legacy protocols.
* **Security & Compliance** – Keycloak/3scale enforce RBAC; Vault manages secrets; encrypted data-at-rest in DB & Kafka.
* **Data Consistency** – Strong consistency where legally required; eventual elsewhere; all changes are auditable.
* **Reliability & Availability** – HA clusters, regional DR, service-mesh resilience (circuit breakers, retries).
* **Performance & Scalability** – Horizontal pod auto-scaling, Redis caching, Elasticsearch search index; P95 latency budget ≤ 2 s.

=== 5. Alternatives Considered

* *Monolithic* application – rejected due to integration complexity and phased migration needs.
* *MuleSoft* for the Integration Hub – rejected because of license costs and heavyweight runtime.
* *Full XA/2PC everywhere* – rejected for throughput concerns; adopted selective strong consistency instead.
