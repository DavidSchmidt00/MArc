= ADR-002 Adopt Apache Camel-K as Integration Hub Runtime
:revdate: 2024-06-12
:status: Accepted

== Context
The CRM must connect to heterogeneous legacy systems (mainframe via MQ, AS/400 flat files, SOAP services) and perform protocol translation, message enrichment, and routing. Requirements include:

* Native Kubernetes deployment to align with OpenShift.
* Low operational overhead / fast scaling for many lightweight routes.
* Ability to reuse the existing Camel route library used inside the organisation.
* Strong observability and integration with service mesh.

Options evaluated:

* MuleSoft Anypoint Runtime
* Red Hat Fuse (classic Camel on JBoss)
* Apache Camel deployed as Spring Boot services
* Apache Camel-K (operator-based, serverless)

== Decision
Use **Apache Camel-K** (v1.15) for the Integration Hub and Anti-Corruption Layer routes.

== Consequences
Positive:

* Operator automates build, deploy, and scaling of routes – lower Ops burden.
* Reuses existing Camel skills and Enterprise Integration Patterns.
* Natively integrates with OpenShift service mesh, Prometheus metrics, Jaeger tracing.
* Rapid iteration; routes written as YAML or Java DSL.

Negative:

* Less maturity than classic Camel deployments; requires cluster tuning.
* Limited community support compared to MuleSoft’s enterprise offering.

Risk mitigation: PoC successful under expected throughput (10 MB/s); fallback is Spring-Boot Camel services with minimal code change.
