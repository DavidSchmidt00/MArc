= ADR-006 Active/Passive DR with MirrorMaker2 & Logical Replication
:revdate: 2024-06-12
:status: Accepted

== Context
Reliability & Availability (ASR #4) require 99.9 % uptime, RPO 5 min, RTO 15 min even if the primary OpenShift region fails.

== Decision
Use an **active/passive** disaster recovery model:

* Secondary OpenShift cluster in Region B.
* PostgreSQL logical replication (async, commit_lag ≤ 3 s).
* Apache Kafka MirrorMaker2 replicates topics from region A → B; lag alert at 30 s.
* ArgoCD maintains GitOps sync; disaster fail-over automated via runbook.

== Consequences
* Meets RPO/RTO targets with manageable cost.
* Potential message loss window equal to MirrorMaker lag (<30 s) but within RPO.
* Requires periodic fail-over drills to maintain readiness.
