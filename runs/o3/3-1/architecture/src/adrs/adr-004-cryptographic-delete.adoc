= ADR-004 Cryptographic Delete for GDPR Right-to-Erasure
:revdate: 2024-06-12
:status: Accepted

== Context
GDPR Article 17 requires complete removal of personal data upon request. The CRM keeps an immutable audit log in Kafka for 10 years; physical deletion is undesirable.

== Decision
Encrypt all PII fields with a per-customer Data Encryption Key (DEK). Store DEKs in HashiCorp Vault Transit engine. To erase data, destroy the DEK in Vault (cryptographic deletion). Events remain but are undecipherable.

== Consequences
* Meets GDPR erasure without breaking audit trails.
* Requires envelope encryption and careful key-management.
* Audit of key destruction events must itself be immutable (see follow-up).
