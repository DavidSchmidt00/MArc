= 2. Architecture Constraints

* Microservice + event-driven style mandated by CTO.
* Each service owns its own datastore (polyglot persistence).
* Kafka (or compatible) must be used as the asynchronous event bus.
* Cloud-native deployment on Kubernetes, no vendor lock-in to a single cloud.
* API Gateway is single ingress; OAuth 2.0/OIDC for authentication.
* PCI-scope must be isolated in a dedicated network segment.
* Disaster-recovery objectives: RPO ≤ 5 min, RTO ≤ 30 min.
* GDPR compliance including data-erasure workflow across all services.
