= ADR-003: Dispatch / Logistics Service Detailed Design

Date: 2024-05-05

== Status
Accepted

== Context

The platform orchestrates real-time assignment of delivery drivers to newly created food orders.
Architecturally-Significant Requirements (ASRs) demand:

* Driver match latency ≤ 15 s (P95) while supporting bursts of 10 k concurrent orders and 50 k active drivers.
* Exactly-once semantics for assignment events that trigger downstream payment capture and order status transitions.
* Privacy-compliant handling of driver location data and GDPR erase requests.
* High availability (≥ 99.95 %), elasticity, and observability.

== Decision

Introduce a dedicated Dispatch / Logistics Service implemented as a **domain-partitioned, event-driven micro-service** with the following internal components (see Building Block 5.3.1):

* **Location Ingestor** – consumes driver-location events and maintains geo-spatial index in Redis-Geo.
* **Driver State Manager** – persists driver status (online/offline/capacity) in Postgres and publishes state changes.
* **Matching Engine** – consumes `OrderCreated` events, performs geo-radius look-ups, scores drivers, and proposes matches.
* **Job Offer Manager** – issues time-boxed job offers via Real-Time Gateway and tracks offer FSM in Redis Streams.
* **Acceptance Processor** – atomically assigns the first accepting driver using Postgres + transactional outbox.
* **Config Watcher** – hot-reloads matching rules broadcast via `ConfigChanged` events.
* **Route Optimiser (plugin)** – optional ETA calculation via external routing API.

Key technology choices:

* Redis Cluster for low-latency geo-queries and distributed locks.
* Debezium Outbox pattern for exactly-once `OrderAssigned` events on Kafka.
* Short-lived JWT + per-message HMAC for authenticated GPS updates.
* Privacy retention policy that hashes or deletes location archives after 30/180 days and supports GDPR erasure.
* Escalation workflow with three retry attempts and deterministic cancel/refund path when no driver is found.

== Consequences

Positive:

* Meets latency and scalability ASRs via in-memory geo-index and stateless matching engine.
* Provides strong consistency for financially relevant assignments.
* Resilient to partial failures (config store outage, Redis degradation) with safe defaults.
* Privacy controls align with GDPR and internal security policies.

Negative / Trade-offs:

* Introduces Redis dependency and complexity around cluster management.
* Additional Glue/Batch jobs for location-data retention increase operational overhead.
* Escalation logic increases messaging volume in driver peak scenarios.

== Alternatives Considered

1. Use PostGIS queries instead of Redis-Geo – rejected due to higher latency under peak load.
2. Centralised monolithic dispatch inside Ordering Service – rejected for scalability and team autonomy reasons.
3. Off-the-shelf SaaS dispatch engine – rejected to keep core competency in-house and avoid per-order fees.
