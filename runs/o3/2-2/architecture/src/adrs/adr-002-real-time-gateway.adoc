= ADR-002: Introduce Dedicated Real-Time Gateway for WebSocket Traffic

== Status
Accepted â€“ 2024-05-05

== Context

Customers and drivers require live updates (<2 s) for order statuses and GPS positions. While the API Gateway handles REST calls efficiently, long-lived WebSocket connections would exhaust its thread/connection pool and complicate scaling.  Mixing request/response and streaming traffic in one component prevents independent tuning.

== Decision

Add a stateless Real-Time Gateway alongside the API Gateway. It will:

* Terminate secure WebSocket (wss) sessions.
* Authenticate via short-lived JWT, then upgrade to WS session token.
* Produce and consume events to/from Kafka topics (driver-location, order-status, chat-msg).
* Scale horizontally based on active connections (HPA, target 5 000 conns/pod).
* Use consistent-hash load-balancing to maintain session affinity.

== Consequences

Positive:

* Independent scaling characteristic from REST workload.
* Simplified connection management and back-pressure handling.
* Reduced risk of DoS on REST pathways.

Negative:

* Extra operational component (build, deploy, monitor).
* Requires duplication of auth/session logic separate from API Gateway.
