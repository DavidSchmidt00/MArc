= 1. Introduction and Goals

Fork & Knife is a food-delivery platform that connects customers, restaurants and delivery drivers.  It aims to provide a restaurant-friendly alternative to high-commission incumbents while delivering a real-time, reliable ordering and logistics experience for customers and drivers.

== 1.1 Requirements Overview

The following Architecturally Significant Requirements (ASRs) drive the solution:

* Scalability to 10 000 concurrent orders and 100 000 active users (burst)
* Near real-time (<2 s P95) order-status propagation and driver-location tracking
* 99.95 % platform / 99.99 % payment availability
* PCI-DSS compliance without storing card data
* GDPR support including right-to-be-forgotten within 30 days
* Maintainability – autonomous teams per domain and independent deployments
* Disaster recovery RPO ≤ 5 min, RTO ≤ 30 min

== 1.2 Quality Goals for the Architecture

|===
|Priority |Quality Goal |Motivation
|1 |Real-time responsiveness |Core user experience – live order tracking and dispatch depend on sub-second event propagation.
|2 |Scalability |Lunch/dinner peaks cause flash traffic; the platform must scale horizontally without service degradation.
|3 |Reliability & Availability |Platform downtime immediately impacts revenue and brand trust; payments are business-critical.
|4 |Security & Compliance |Handling payments and personal data mandates strict PCI/GDPR adherence.
|5 |Maintainability & Team Autonomy |Rapid feature delivery across separate marketplace domains.
